    DESCRIPTION 
        "This MIB module provides the ability to configure the 
         Port Web Authentication (PWA) component in a switch.
         PWA provides a way of authenticating a user on a 
         switch port before allowing the user general access
         to the network. Only the essential protocols and
         services required by the authentication process
         are allowed on the segment between the end-station
         and the switch port. All other traffic will be
         discarded.  When a user is in the unauthenticated
         state, any traffic generated by the end-station
         will not go beyond the switch port that they are 
         connected to.

         The PWA/login process from the user standpoint is
         simple. The user makes a request via their favorite
         web browser for the 'secureharbour' web page. Depending 
         upon the authenticated state of the port, a login page
         is provided so that the user can enter their username
         and password, or a logout page is presented to the user.
         When they submit their login page, the switch will then 
         authenticate them via a preconfigured radius server. 
         If the login is successful, then the port that the
         end-station is connected to will be turned on and
         full network access will be granted according to the 
         users port configuration on the switch.

         This MIB module also provides status about the PWA
         component and statistics about all current users who
         are logged into the switch."

         the process of obtaining their official IP addresses and to
         begin using them.  The default value of 30 seconds has been
         shown to be adequate in most environments.  In some networks
         this time period may need to be longer, and in other networks
         it could be shorter.

         In networks that only use static IP addresses a time period on
         the order of 5 to 10 seconds may be sufficient.  A period of
         less than 5 seconds is not recommended as there is a slight
