    DESCRIPTION
        "This sub-tree contains information about PDU clusters.  Clusters are
         groups of PDU's under a single monitoring or control domain."

lgpPduGrpSysStatus OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX      Unsigned32
MAX-ACCESS  read-only
STATUS      current
DESCRIPTION
    "This value represents a bit-field of the various operational 
     states of the PDUs that are part of the cluster of PDUs 
     being monitored by this agent.   

     This value is the bit-wise logical OR of all of the 
     'lgpPduEntrySysStatus' columns in the 'lgpPduTable' 
     which represents the combined statuses of all PDUs for this agent.

     Note the bit-position is given parenthetically next to the operational 
     state in the description below.  The bit position is big-endian 
     (least significant digit is the right-most digit).  The state is 
     present in the PDU when the bit is on (value = 1). 

     The value is a logical OR of all of the following potential states of 
     each PDU in the cluster.

         normalOperation(1)
             One or more PDUs in the cluster are operating normally with no 
             active warnings or alarms.
         startUp(2)
             One or more PDUs are in the startup state (initializing).  Control
             and monitoring operations may be inhibited or unavailable
             while the PDU is in this state.  This state will clear 
             automatically when the PDU(s) are fully initialized and ready to
             accept control and monitoring commands.
         unknownNoSupport(4)
             The state of one or more PDUs are not known at this time or 
             there is no support for this piece of information from 1 or more 
             PDUs in the cluster/group.     
         normalWithWarning(8)
             One or more PDUs are operating normally with one or more active 
             warnings.  Appropriate personnel should investigate the 
             warning(s) as soon as possible and take appropriate action. 
         normalWithAlarm(16)
             One or more PDUs are operating normally with one or more active 
             alarms.  Appropriate personnel should investigate the alarm(s)
             as soon as possible and take appropriate action. 
         abnormalOperation(32)
            One ore more PDUs are operating abnormally.  There is a 
            failure within the system that is unexpected under normal 
            operating conditions.  Appropriate personnel should investigate
            the cause as soon as possible.  The normal functioning of
            the system is likely inhibited.  
         unknownCommFailure(64)
            The state of one or more PDUs are not known due to a communications
            failure between the PDU hardware and the communications
            module.  This state is usually indicative of a hardware 
            problem.
