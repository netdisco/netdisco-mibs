Netdisco - MIB Repository
Originally by Max Baker, 2004

    Version 4.013

    This is a workable set of SNMP MIBs to use with Netdisco 
    and other network managment tools. All glitches have been
    painstakingly fixed up to parse correctly under the latest
    release of net-snmp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING THESE MIBS OUTSIDE OF NETDISCO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Copy extras/contrib/snmp.conf to either

        /usr/local/share/snmp/snmp.conf
    OR
        ~/.snmp/snmp.conf

    Be sure to look in the file and change things to match your environment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDING NEW OR UPDATED MIBs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As well as MIBs, we maintain the SNMP::Info Perl distribution and the Netdisco
network management application. Missing or incorrect device support in these
packages is usually caused by missing or outdated files in netdisco-mibs, and
missing support in SNMP::Info.

    See the CONTRIBUTING file for further details.
