Netdisco
MIB Files
Max Baker
-------------------
I'm trying to maintain a workable set of MIBS to use with Netdisco. 
I would like to be able to do snmpwalks without having everything blow up.

Include only the dirs you need.

These mibs should cover all the devices listed in 
    http://snmp-info.sourceforge.net/DeviceMatrix.html

allied:
    I painstakingly merged AThub-mib and Allied 4.1 MIB together to form one ATI-MIB

asante:

cisco:
    Last update of v2.tar.gz - 11/01/04
    From: ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs

    tar xvfz v2.tar.gz
    delete *CAPABILITY.my
    copy ESSWITCH* from v1

    run ./rm_cisco_dups to get rid of RFC mibs and weird dups

    (From http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=8111644)
    cd cisco && patch -p1 < ../cisco1.patch
    rm *.orig *.rej
    
rfc:
    From instructions inside of net-snmp

    cd net-snmp*/mibs
    cd mibs/ 
    make -f Makefile.mib allmibs
    cp -r /usr/local/share/snmp/rfc.orig rfc
    patch -d rfc < rfcmibs.diff
    rm *.orig
    download ftp://ftp.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1271.txt
    run smistrip on it

nortel:
    Includes :
        BayStack425.3.0.0.18.zip
        p16a1100.mib.zip (passport 1100)

    rm RFC* rfc*
    rm other rfcs in other names

hp:
    From: http://www.hp.com/rnd/software/MIBs.htm

    tar xvfZ mibs-nov03.tar.Z
    rm *.txt *.htm cisco-* rfc*
    rm ieee802* (moved to rfc/)
    rm hc-rmon.mib
    rm iana*

    seems there are two HP-SN-ROOT-MIB files?
    rm hp-sn-root.mib
