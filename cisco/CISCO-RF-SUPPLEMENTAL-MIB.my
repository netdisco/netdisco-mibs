    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB was designed to complement the CISCO-RF-MIB by
        providing additional optional status and configuration control 
        for redundant CPU platforms.

        However, the MIB should also be applicable to redundant 
        platforms which don't use the RF Redundancy Framework software 
        since it makes no direct references to any CISCO-RF-MIB objects 
        or textual conventions and no direct reference to any RF 
        states, RF events or internal information.

        Glossary of terms used in this document:

            Active -   A redundant CPU which is actively controlling 
                       the system.

            Running configuration - The runtime configuration of a
                       system which reflects current configured 
                       hardware or software settings. Runtime 
                       configuration which is not stored in 
                       non-volatile memory may be lost if the system
                       loses power.

            Standby -  A redundant CPU which is not currently 
                       controlling the system, but which can take 
                       over control if the Active CPU fails.

            Startup configuration - A copy of system configuration
                       stored in non-volatile memory which can be
                       applied following a system powerup.

                       For platforms where all runtime configuration
                       is automatically stored in a non-volatile
                       manner, the running and startup configurations
                       are always identical.

            Switchover - The transfer of control from one CPU to a 
                       redundant CPU.

            Sync -     The mirroring (or synchronizing) of system 
                       state, configuration, statistics or other 
                       information from the Active CPU to a Standby 
                       CPU to allow it to maintain full system 
                       control following a switchover."

-- The following "System" sub-group definitions are made up of

cRfSupSysAvailableStartTime OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX          DateAndTime
    MAX-ACCESS      read-only
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The date and time when this system began providing
        uninterrupted operation. This includes the time while either 
        redundant unit was Active, but may also include brief intervals 
        during switchover where the new Active unit was operational, 
        but not yet reachable for network management purposes. It may 
        also include intervals where no Standby unit was offering 
        protection, as long as the Active unit was still operational.  

        It normally changes only if an unprotected system restart
        occurs or if a Standby unit was forced to take over before 
        the initial database sync was completed.

        However, it may also change if the system's Time of Day clock 
        is changed or adjusted.  This object will be inaccurate if the
        system's Time of Day clock has not been set accurately. However,
        it should be implemented in such a way that when the system's 
        Time of Day clock is adjusted to an accurate setting, 
        cRfSupSysAvailableStartTime will also adjust to show the 
        accurate available start time." 
    ::= { cRfSupSystem 1 }

cRfSupSysSwitchoverTime OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX          DateAndTime
    MAX-ACCESS      read-only
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The date and time when the last CPU switchover took place.
        This object will remain uninstantiated if no switchovers have 
        taken place since the current Active CPU was initialized." 
    ::= { cRfSupSystem 2 }

cRfSupSysSwitchovers OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX          Counter32
    MAX-ACCESS      read-only
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The number of times that switchovers have occurred since
        cRfSupSysAvailableStartTime.

        This object will remain uninstantiated if no switchovers have 
        taken place since the current Active CPU was initialized
        or if a Standby unit was forced to take over before the 
        initial database sync was completed." 
    ::= { cRfSupSystem 3 }

cRfSupSysRunningConfigSyncTime OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX          DateAndTime
    MAX-ACCESS      read-only
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The date and time when the running configuration was last
        successfully synced from the current Active unit to the 
        Standby unit. 

        This object will remain uninstantiated if no sync has yet
        taken place since the current Active CPU was initialized
        or if a Standby unit was forced to take over before the 
        initial database sync was completed.

        Since automatic running configuration syncs are event driven 
        and can be disabled by configuration, this time doesn't
        directly indicate whether Standby software reflects the
        running configuration of the Active unit.

        Instead, see the cRfSupSysRunningConfigOper object to 
        determine whether Standby running configuration is in 
        sync with the Active CPU."

cRfSupSysRunningConfigAdmin OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX          RfSupSyncAdminState

    DESCRIPTION
        "Enables/Disables automatic running configuration syncs only.
        Doesn't affect other types of sync activity. If set to the 
        default value enableAutoSync, the Active unit will send the 
        full current running configuration following any operation
        that changes the running configuration.

        Standby running configuration is being kept actively in sync 
        with the Active unit."

cRfSupSysStartupConfigSyncTime OBJECT-TYPE

    DESCRIPTION
        "The date and time when the startup configuration was last
        successfully synced from the current Active unit to the 
        Standby unit(s). 

        This object will remain uninstantiated if no sync has yet
        taken place since the current Active CPU was initialized
        or if a Standby unit was forced to take over before the 
        initial database sync was completed.

        For platforms where running configuration is always stored 
        in a non-volatile manner, this object should be identical
        to cRfSupSysRunningConfigSyncTime.

        Since automatic startup configuration syncs are event driven

        directly reflect whether Standby startup configuration is 
        in sync with the Active unit.

    DESCRIPTION
        "The fault severity of a redundant unit, as calculated by
        software. The value zero represents a good unit with no 
        detected faults. Higher values represent progressively more 
        serious faults.  If it's not possible to determine any current 
        or prior severity information about a unit, the value unknown 
        should be returned.

        Unlike some severity definitions, cRfSupCpuActiveSeverity 
        should not be downgraded when it switches from being Active. 
        The severity for a faulty Standby unit should correspond to 
        the system impact it would have if it were made to be the 
        Active unit, assuming the severity can be determined while 
        Standby.

        The severity can be affected by either hardware or software 
        faults with the CPU itself. It can also be affected by faults
        which prevent this CPU from interacting with one or more other
        system components (such as linecards), even when the actual 
        faulty Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) is not the CPU itself.

        As a minimum, the nonFaulty and fullyTrafficAffectingFault
        values should be supported on any platform supporting this 
        object. Support of the other severity values is preferred, 
        but optional."
