    DESCRIPTION
        "This is the MIB module for the support of Channel Bonding
        Protocol for the Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS).

        Wideband DOCSIS is a method of increasing downstream
        bandwidth by simultaneously transmitting DOCSIS data
        over multiple RF channels. This DOCSIS data is
        organized as a sequence of 188-byte MPEG-TS data packets.

        A Wideband CMTS (WCMTS) is a CMTS that also transmits
        Wideband MPEG-TS packets.

        An Edge QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) device is one
        which provides the QAM and used to couple the Wideband MPEG-TS
        packet onto the HFC plant.

        A Wideband Cable Modem (WCM) is a CableModem (CM) that
        is able to receive Wideband MPEG-TS packets.

        A wideband channel or Bonded Group (BG) is a logical
        grouping of one or more physical RF channels over which
        MPEG-TS packets are carried. Wideband channel carries DOCSIS
        bonded packets encapsulated in MPEG-TS packets from a
        WCMTS to one or more WCMs.

        Packets outgoing from WCMTS to the WCM are formatted with
        the DOCSIS Header. The DOCSIS packets are then formatted into
        MPEG-TS data packets. These are 188 byte MPEG packets
        containing the DOCSIS information.
        Within DOCSIS Header of the WB Channel there is an extended
        header called, DOCSIS Bonding Extended Header, the format of
        which is shown below:

         --------------------------------------------------------
        |  ----------------------------------------------------  |
        | |  TYPE | LEN |       BSID           |      SEQ        |
        |  ----------------------------------------------------  |
        | |    byte 0   |     byte 1-2         |    byte 3-4     |
        |--------------------------------------------------------|
                      DOCSIS Bonding Extended Header

        BSID is the Bonding Service IDentifier, it defines a sequence
        number for a Wideband channel. It is used by the WCM to
        re-sequence packets received over downstream channels to
        maintain packet order. SEQ is per service flow sequence number.
        Whereas TYPE is the type of the Bonding Extended Header and LEN
        specifies its length.

        A Narrowband Channel is a standard DOCSIS downstream channel
        which contains exactly one RF channel.
        The wideband protocol utilizes the existing narrowband
        downstream channel for carrying the MAC management and
        signaling messages and the associated narrowband upstream
        for return data traffic and signaling.

        The channel bonding protocol supports multiple wideband
        bonded groups. This will allow the WCM to listen to multiple
        bonded groups at the same time. This would support (for example)
        multicast video being sent to a CPE device on the LAN side of
        the WCM in addition to standard DOCSIS data.

        Channel Bonding allows two types of Bonding Group (BG) interfaces.
        These are Secondary BG interface and non-Secondary BG
        interface. The Secondary BG interfaces will carry the multicast
        traffic, whereas, the non-Secondary BG interface will carry the
        non-multicast traffic.
        This MIB also allows for configuration of the RF channels
        on the WCMTS, as well as the association between the RF and
        narrowband downstream channels with the BG channel.

        Fiber Node is an optical node which terminates the fiber based
        downstream signal as an electrical signal onto a coaxial RF cable.

        DEPI:  Downstream external physical interface. 
        TSID:  MPEG2 Transport Stream ID.
        SFP:   Small Form-Factor Pluggable."
