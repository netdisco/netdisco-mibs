    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module for the management of Call Home feature
        within the framework of Cisco's Call Home architecture.
        Customers deploying solutions to run mission critical
        applications such as storage solutions demand very high
        availability and Serviceability from their products
        and/or support partners.
        To meet these requirements, a feature called 
        'Call Home' is provided which allows the system
        experiencing Hardware/Software problems to 
        automatically send the relevant failure information 
        back to the Support Center at the Support Partners for 
        troubleshooting or to get replacement hardware 
        dispatched. This feature also provides advanced
        features that allow storage systems to send 
        performance, accounting and system health information 
        in addition to just the fault information."

        xml (1)       - XML (Extensible Markup Language) 
                      - encoded.            
        fullText (2)  - Plain text without any encoding.
        shortText (3) - Short text without any encoding

        The context of the Call Home message depends on the 
        message. In general, all the Call Home message is sent 
        with following information : 

        'Subject : System Notification from '
        'TimeStamp :' 
        'Message Name :' 
        'Message Type :' 
        'Level :'

        'Affected FRU Slot :'  
        'Affected FRU Hardware Version :' 
        'Affected FRU Software Version :' 

        Following is required for all the messages : 
        'Command Output :'

        The command output may depend on the implementation and
        severity of the Call Home message. But at minimum, 
        following information which are contained in the output
        of the CLI commands must be included.
        - Hardware model
        - software version
        - context information explaining the state of the device.
        - uptime
        - brief inventory information

        The exact format depends on the format type chosen.
        For 'xml', the above information is encoded in the XML
        format. For 'fullText', above information is sent out in
        plain text. For 'shortText', only following information 
        is provided in plain text:
        'Subject : System Notification from '

    DESCRIPTION
        "AlertGroups are a pre-defined set of Call Home alerts.
        Users can specify these alert groups for a destination
        profile, to choose the Call Home alerts messages to be
        sent out to the destination. This object represents 
        the list of alert groups (alert group types)
        configured for a destination profile.

        Each 'bit' within the value of an object of this type,
        specifies a configured alert group type.
        Bit position '0' ( most significant bit) in the value 
        of this object is reserved.

        The value of each 'bit' (set/reset) represents whether 
        an alert group type is configured or not for a 
        particular destination profile.

        Bit position 1, represents whether the 
        'callHomeAlertGroupName' corresponding to the 
        'callHomeAlertGroupTypeIndex' 1 in the 
        'callHomeAlertGroupTypeTable' is configured or
        not for a particular destination profile.

        Bit position 2, represents whether the 
        'callHomeAlertGroupName' corresponding to the 
        'callHomeAlertGroupTypeIndex' 2 in the 
        'callHomeAlertGroupTypeTable' is configured or
        not for a particular destination profile.

        If there is no entry in the 'alertGroupTypeTable',
        with 'alertGroupTypeIndex' 'n', then
        bit position 'n' in the value of this object is
        irrelevant. 

        If the length of an object of this type is less
        than 8 bytes, then the alert group types which are 
        not represented are not considered to be part of this
        list, i.e., effectively, the string is extended to
        be of length 8 bytes by appending bytes
        containing x'00'. Note that this means that the
        zero length string represents the 'list is empty'
        value."

        Regular Expressions:
        -------------------

        A regular expression is a pattern (a phrase, number, or more
        complex pattern):

        Regular expressions are case sensitive and allow for complex
        matching requirements. Simple regular expressions include
        entries like Serial, misses, or 138.

        Complex regular expressions include entries like 00210... , 
        (is ), or [Oo]utput.

        Some Practical examples of regular expressions:
        ----------------------------------------------
        The examples correspond with the various ways that you can
        use regular expressions in your configurations.

        For example, syslog messages on IOS look as follows:
        a.
        --
        2004 Jul 21 13:26:55 %SYS-5-REDUNDANTCLOCK_OK: Redundant
        clock recovered
        b.

        2004 Jul 21 13:26:59 %SYS-5-REDUNDANTCLOCK_FAIL: Redundant
        clock failed
        c.
        --
        2004 Jul 26 16:53:47 %MGMT-5-LOGIN_FAIL:User failed to log
        in from 171.69.48.75 via Telnet - max attempt reached


        A pattern of REDUNDANTCLOCK.* would cause all the syslogs 
        with severity greater than specified by
        ccmProfileAlertGroupSeverity
        and having a pattern  REDUNDANTCLOCK followed by
        REDUNDANTCLOCK followed by any number of occurrences (*)
        of any character (.) resulting in corresponding Call Home
        messages being generated for syslog alert group.

        So both messages a and b in above examples will be resulting
        in issuance of Call Home messages for the pattern 
        REDUNDANTCLOCK.*.

        Next, a pattern of ^Telnet would cause all the syslogs 
        with severity greater than specified by
        ccmProfileAlertGroupSeverity and having a string starting 
        and with Telnet resulting in corresponding Call Home
        messages being generated for syslog alert group.

        A pattern of LOGIN_FAIL$ would cause all the syslogs with
        severity greater than specified by 
        ccmProfileAlertGroupSeverity and having a string ending in
