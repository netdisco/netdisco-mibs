.1.3.6.1.2.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::system,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2,SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3,SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4,SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person. If no contact information is known, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5,SNMPv2-MIB::sysName,OCTET,read-write,,current,,An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6,SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone closet, 3rd floor'). If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

Additional values for ifType are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), through updating the syntax of the IANAifType textual convention.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8,IF-MIB::ifOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3):unknown(4):dormant(5):notPresent(6):lowerLayerDown(7),The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,IF-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10,IF-MIB::ifInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11,IF-MIB::ifInUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,IF-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,IF-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17,IF-MIB::ifOutUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.18,IF-MIB::ifOutNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.21,IF-MIB::ifOutQLen,Gauge32,read-only,,deprecated,,The length of the output packet queue (in packets).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType. If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available, the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.3,RFC1213-MIB::ipInReceives,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of input datagrams received from interfaces, including those received in error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.4,RFC1213-MIB::ipInHdrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams discarded due to errors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IP options, etc.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipInAddrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams discarded because the IP address in their IP header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space). Note that this counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly.

Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.

Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.

Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipRouteType object.

For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0. It should be noted that all IP routing subsystems implicitly use this mechanism.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric5,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,RFC1213-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.8.5.1.15,RFC1213-MIB::egpNeighEventTrigger,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,start(1):stop(2),A control variable used to trigger operator- initiated Start and Stop events. When read, this variable always returns the most recent value that egpNeighEventTrigger was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the node, it returns a value of `stop'. When set, this variable causes a Start or Stop event on the specified neighbor, as specified on pages 8-10 of RFC 904. Briefly, a Start event causes an Idle peer to begin neighbor acquisition and a non-Idle peer to reinitiate neighbor acquisition. A stop event causes a non-Idle peer to return to the Idle state until a Start event occurs, either via egpNeighEventTrigger or otherwise.

Also, implementations which authenticate community-based SNMP messages using check(s) in addition to matching the community name (for example, by also checking whether the message originated from a transport address allowed to use a specified community name) MAY include in this value the number of messages which failed the additional check(s). It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any security model which is used to authenticate community-based SNMP messages specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value.

The precise conditions under which this counter is incremented (if at all) depend on how the SNMP entity implements its access control mechanism and how its applications interact with that access control mechanism. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any access control mechanism which is used to control access to and visibility of MIB instrumentation specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.0.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrHealth,,,,,,********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********** In a system containing a single managed repeater, the rptrHealth notification conveys information related to the operational status of the repeater. It is sent either when the value of rptrOperStatus changes, or upon completion of a non-disruptive test. The rptrHealth notification must contain the rptrOperStatus object. The agent may optionally include the rptrHealthText object in the varBind list. See the rptrOperStatus and rptrHealthText objects for descriptions of the information that is sent. The agent must throttle the generation of consecutive rptrHealth traps so that there is at least a five-second gap between traps of this type. When traps are throttled, they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time. (Note that 'generating' a trap means sending to all configured recipients.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.0.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrGroupChange,,,,,,********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********** In a system containing a single managed repeater, this notification is sent when a change occurs in the group structure of the repeater. This occurs only when a group is logically or physically removed from or added to a repeater. The varBind list contains the identifier of the group that was removed or added. The agent must throttle the generation of consecutive rptrGroupChange traps for the same group so that there is at least a five-second gap between traps of this type. When traps are throttled, they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time. (Note that 'generating' a trap means sending to all configured recipients.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.0.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrResetEvent,,,,,,********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********** In a system containing a single managed repeater-unit, the rptrResetEvent notification conveys information related to the operational status of the repeater. This trap is sent on completion of a repeater reset action. A repeater reset action is defined as an a transition to the START state of Fig 9-2 in section 9 [IEEE 802.3 Std], when triggered by a management command (e.g., an SNMP Set on the rptrReset object). The agent must throttle the generation of consecutive rptrResetEvent traps so that there is at least a five-second gap between traps of this type. When traps are throttled, they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time. (Note that 'generating' a trap means sending to all configured recipients.) The rptrResetEvent trap is not sent when the agent restarts and sends an SNMP coldStart or warmStart trap. However, it is recommended that a repeater agent send the rptrOperStatus object as an optional object with its coldStart and warmStart trap PDUs. The rptrOperStatus object must be included in the varbind list sent with this trap. The agent may optionally include the rptrHealthText object as well.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.0.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrInfoHealth,,,,,,In a system containing multiple managed repeaters, the rptrInfoHealth notification conveys information related to the operational status of a repeater. It is sent either when the value of rptrInfoOperStatus changes, or upon completion of a non-disruptive test. The agent must throttle the generation of consecutive rptrInfoHealth notifications for the same repeater so that there is at least a five-second gap between notifications of this type. When notifications are throttled, they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time. (Note that 'generating' a notification means sending to all configured recipients.)

Within each managed repeater, the groups are uniquely numbered in the range from 1 to rptrGroupCapacity. Some groups may not be present in the repeater, in which case the actual number of groups present will be less than rptrGroupCapacity. The number of groups present will never be greater than rptrGroupCapacity. Note: In practice, this will generally be the number of field-replaceable units (i.e., modules, cards, or boards) that can fit in the physical repeater enclosure, and the group numbers will correspond to numbers marked on the physical enclosure.

The rptrHealthText object may be consulted for more specific information about the state of the repeater's health. In the case of multiple kinds of failures (e.g., repeater failure and port failure), the value of this attribute shall reflect the highest priority failure in the following order, listed highest priority first: rptrFailure(3) groupFailure(4) portFailure(5) generalFailure(6).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.1.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrHealthText,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********** The health text object is a text string that provides information relevant to the operational state of the repeater. Agents may use this string to provide detailed information on current failures, including how they were detected, and/or instructions for problem resolution. The contents are agent-specific.

Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect. The agent will always return the value noReset(1) when this object is read. After receiving a request to set this variable to reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset for a short period. For example, the implementor may choose to delay the reset long enough to allow the SNMP response to be transmitted. In any event, the SNMP response must be transmitted. This action does not reset the management counters defined in this document nor does it affect the portAdminStatus parameters. Included in this action is the execution of a disruptive Self-Test with the following characteristics: a) The nature of the tests is not specified. b) The test resets the repeater but without affecting management information about the repeater. c) The test does not inject packets onto any segment. d) Packets received during the test may or may not be transferred. e) The test does not interfere with management functions. After performing this self-test, the agent will update the repeater health information (including rptrOperStatus and rptrHealthText), and send a rptrHealth trap.

After performing this test, the agent will update the repeater health information (including rptrOperStatus and rptrHealthText) and send a rptrHealth trap. Note that this definition allows returning an 'okay' result after doing a trivial test. Setting this object to noSelfTest(1) has no effect. The agent will always return the value noSelfTest(1) when this object is read.

This value may be allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides a straight-forward and unambiguous means for determining what kind of group is being managed. For example, this object could take the value 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.2.14 if vendor 'Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, and had assigned the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.2.14 to its 'Wilma Flintstone 6-Port FOIRL Plug-in Module.'

A status of notPresent(4) indicates that the group is temporarily or permanently physically and/or logically not a part of the repeater. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent effectively removes notPresent entries from the table. A status of operational(2) indicates that the group is functioning, and a status of malfunctioning(3) indicates that the group is malfunctioning in some way.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.2.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrGroupLastOperStatusChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,deprecated,,********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********** An object that contains the value of sysUpTime at the time when the last of the following occurred: 1) the agent cold- or warm-started; 2) the row for the group was created (such as when the group was added to the system); or 3) the value of rptrGroupOperStatus for the group changed. A value of zero indicates that the group's operational status has not changed since the agent last restarted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.2.1.1.6,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrGroupPortCapacity,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The rptrGroupPortCapacity is the number of ports that can be contained within the group. Valid range is 1-2147483647. Within each group, the ports are uniquely numbered in the range from 1 to rptrGroupPortCapacity. Some ports may not be present in the system, in which case the actual number of ports present will be less than the value of rptrGroupPortCapacity. The number of ports present in the group will never be greater than the value of rptrGroupPortCapacity. Note: In practice, this will generally be the number of ports on a module, card, or board, and the port numbers will correspond to numbers marked on the physical embodiment.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,This object identifies the port within the group for which this entry contains information. This identifies the port independently from the repeater it may be attached to. The numbering scheme for ports is implementation specific; however, this value can never be greater than rptrGroupPortCapacity for the associated group.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),Setting this object to disabled(2) disables the port. A disabled port neither transmits nor receives. Once disabled, a port must be explicitly enabled to restore operation. A port which is disabled when power is lost or when a reset is exerted shall remain disabled when normal operation resumes. The admin status takes precedence over auto- partition and functionally operates between the auto-partition mechanism and the AUI/PMA. Setting this object to enabled(1) enables the port and exerts a BEGIN on the port's auto-partition state machine. (In effect, when a port is disabled, the value of rptrPortAutoPartitionState for that port is frozen until the port is next enabled. When the port becomes enabled, the rptrPortAutoPartitionState becomes notAutoPartitioned(1), regardless of its pre-disabling state.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortAutoPartitionState,INTEGER,read-only,,current,notAutoPartitioned(1):autoPartitioned(2),The autoPartitionState flag indicates whether the port is currently partitioned by the repeater's auto-partition protection. The conditions that cause port partitioning are specified in partition state machine in Sections 9 and 27 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]. They are not differentiated here.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,operational(1):notOperational(2):notPresent(3),This object indicates the port's operational status. The notPresent(3) status indicates the port is physically removed (note this may or may not be possible depending on the type of port.) The operational(1) status indicates that the port is enabled (see rptrPortAdminStatus) and working, even though it might be auto-partitioned (see rptrPortAutoPartitionState). If this object has the value operational(1) and rptrPortAdminStatus is set to disabled(2), it is expected that this object's value will soon change to notOperational(2).

The repeater identified by a particular value of this object is the same as that identified by the same value of rptrInfoId. A value of zero indicates that this port currently is not a member of any repeater.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.4.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrInfoTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of information about each non-trivial repeater. The number of entries depends on the physical configuration of the managed system.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.4.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrInfoEntry,,not-accessible,rptrInfoId,current,,An entry in the table, containing information about a single non-trivial repeater.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.4.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrInfoReset,INTEGER,read-write,,current,noReset(1):reset(2),Setting this object to reset(2) causes a transition to the START state of Fig 9-2 in section 9 [IEEE 802.3 Std] for a 10Mb/s repeater, and to the START state of Fig 27-2 in section 27 of that standard for a 100Mb/s repeater. Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect. The agent will always return the value noReset(1) when this object is read. After receiving a request to set this variable to reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset for a short period. For example, the implementor may choose to delay the reset long enough to allow the SNMP response to be transmitted. In any event, the SNMP response must be transmitted. This action does not reset the management counters defined in this document nor does it affect the portAdminStatus parameters. Included in this action is the execution of a disruptive Self-Test with the following characteristics: a) The nature of the tests is not specified. b) The test resets the repeater but without affecting management information about the repeater. c) The test does not inject packets onto any segment. d) Packets received during the test may or may not be transferred. e) The test does not interfere with management functions. After performing this self-test, the agent will update the repeater health information (including rptrInfoOperStatus), and send a rptrInfoResetEvent notification.

Regular retrieval of the information in this table provides a means of tracking the performance and health of the networked devices attached to this group's ports. The counters in this table are redundant in the sense that they are the summations of information already available through other objects. However, these sums provide a considerable optimization of network management traffic over the otherwise necessary retrieval of the individual counters included in each sum. Note: Group-level counters are deprecated in this MIB. It is recommended that management applications instead use the repeater-level counters contained in the rptrMonTable.

This counter is incremented by one for each frame received on this port whose OctetCount is greater than or equal to minFrameSize and less than or equal to maxFrameSize (Ref: IEEE 802.3 Std, 4.4.2.1) and for which the FCSError and CollisionEvent signals are not asserted. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. This statistic provides one of the parameters necessary for obtaining the packet error rate. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 80 hours at 10Mb/s.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This object is the number of octets contained in valid frames that have been received on this port. This counter is incremented by OctetCount for each frame received on this port which has been determined to be a readable frame (i.e., including FCS octets but excluding framing bits and dribble bits). A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter in a 10Mb/s repeater is 58 minutes. For ports receiving traffic at a maximum rate in a 100Mb/s repeater, this counter can roll over in less than 6 minutes. Since that amount of time could be less than a management station's poll cycle time, in order to avoid a loss of information a management station is advised to also poll the rptrMonitorPortUpper32Octets object, or to use the 64-bit counter defined by rptrMonitorPortHCReadableOctets instead of the two 32-bit counters.

A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 80 hours at 10Mb/s.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.6,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortAlignmentErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each frame received on this port with the FCSError and FramingError signals asserted and CollisionEvent signal deasserted and whose OctetCount is greater than or equal to minFrameSize and less than or equal to maxFrameSize (Ref: IEEE 802.3 Std, 4.4.2.1). If rptrMonitorPortAlignmentErrors is incremented then the rptrMonitorPortFCSErrors Counter shall not be incremented for the same frame. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 80 hours at 10Mb/s.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.7,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortFrameTooLongs,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each frame received on this port whose OctetCount is greater than maxFrameSize (Ref: 4.4.2.1, IEEE 802.3 Std). If rptrMonitorPortFrameTooLongs is incremented then neither the rptrMonitorPortAlignmentErrors nor the rptrMonitorPortFCSErrors counter shall be incremented for the frame. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 61 days in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.8,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortShortEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each CarrierEvent on this port with ActivityDuration less than ShortEventMaxTime. ShortEventMaxTime is greater than 74 bit times and less than 82 bit times. ShortEventMaxTime has tolerances included to provide for circuit losses between a conformance test point at the AUI and the measurement point within the state machine. Notes: ShortEvents may indicate externally generated noise hits which will cause the repeater to transmit Runts to its other ports, or propagate a collision (which may be late) back to the transmitting DTE and damaged frames to the rest of the network. Implementors may wish to consider selecting the ShortEventMaxTime towards the lower end of the allowed tolerance range to accommodate bit losses suffered through physical channel devices not budgeted for within this standard. The significance of this attribute is different in 10 and 100 Mb/s collision domains. Clause 9 repeaters perform fragment extension of short events which would be counted as runts on the interconnect ports of other repeaters. Clause 27 repeaters do not perform fragment extension. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 16 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.9,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortRunts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each CarrierEvent on this port that meets one of the following two conditions. Only one test need be made. a) The ActivityDuration is greater than ShortEventMaxTime and less than ValidPacketMinTime and the CollisionEvent signal is deasserted. b) The OctetCount is less than 64, the ActivityDuration is greater than ShortEventMaxTime and the CollisionEvent signal is deasserted. ValidPacketMinTime is greater than or equal to 552 bit times and less than 565 bit times. An event whose length is greater than 74 bit times but less than 82 bit times shall increment either the shortEvents counter or the runts counter but not both. A CarrierEvent greater than or equal to 552 bit times but less than 565 bit times may or may not be counted as a runt. ValidPacketMinTime has tolerances included to provide for circuit losses between a conformance test point at the AUI and the measurement point within the state machine. Runts usually indicate collision fragments, a normal network event. In certain situations associated with large diameter networks a percentage of collision fragments may exceed ValidPacketMinTime. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 16 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.10,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For a clause 9 repeater, this counter is incremented by one for any CarrierEvent signal on any port for which the CollisionEvent signal on this port is asserted. For a clause 27 repeater port the counter increments on entering the Collision Count Increment state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]). A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 16 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.11,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortLateEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For a clause 9 repeater port, this counter is incremented by one for each CarrierEvent on this port in which the CollIn(X) variable transitions to the value SQE (Ref: 9.6.6.2, IEEE 802.3 Std) while the ActivityDuration is greater than the LateEventThreshold. For a clause 27 repeater port, this counter is incremented by one on entering the Collision Count Increment state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8) while the ActivityDuration is greater than the LateEvent- Threshold. Such a CarrierEvent is counted twice, as both a collision and as a lateEvent. The LateEventThreshold is greater than 480 bit times and less than 565 bit times. LateEventThreshold has tolerances included to permit an implementation to build a single threshold to serve as both the LateEventThreshold and ValidPacketMinTime threshold. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 81 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.12,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortVeryLongEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For a clause 9 repeater port, this counter is incremented by one for each CarrierEvent whose ActivityDuration is greater than the MAU Jabber Lockup Protection timer TW3 (Ref: 9.6.1 & 9.6.5, IEEE 802.3 Std). For a clause 27 repeater port, this counter is incremented by one on entry to the Rx Jabber state of the receiver timer state diagram (fig 27-7). Other counters may be incremented as appropriate. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.13,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortDataRateMismatches,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each frame received by this port that meets all of the conditions required by only one of the following two measurement methods: Measurement method A: 1) The CollisionEvent signal is not asserted (10Mb/s operation) or the Collision Count Increment state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]) has not been entered (100Mb/s operation). 2) The ActivityDuration is greater than ValidPacketMinTime. 3) The frequency (data rate) is detectably mismatched from the local transmit frequency. Measurement method B: 1) The CollisionEvent signal is not asserted (10Mb/s operation) or the Collision Count Increment state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]) has not been entered (100Mb/s operation). 2) The OctetCount is greater than 63. 3) The frequency (data rate) is detectably mismatched from the local transmit frequency. The exact degree of mismatch is vendor specific and is to be defined by the vendor for conformance testing. When this event occurs, other counters whose increment conditions were satisfied may or may not also be incremented, at the implementor's discretion. Whether or not the repeater was able to maintain data integrity is beyond the scope of this standard. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.14,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortAutoPartitions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each time the repeater has automatically partitioned this port. The conditions that cause a clause 9 repeater port to partition are specified in the partition state diagram in clause 9 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]. They are not differentiated here. A clause 27 repeater port partitions on entry to the Partition Wait state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8 in [IEEE 802.3 Std]). A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.15,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortTotalErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of errors which have occurred on this port. This counter is the summation of the values of other error counters (for the same port), namely: rptrMonitorPortFCSErrors, rptrMonitorPortAlignmentErrors, rptrMonitorPortFrameTooLongs, rptrMonitorPortShortEvents, rptrMonitorPortLateEvents, rptrMonitorPortVeryLongEvents, rptrMonitorPortDataRateMismatches, and rptrMonitorPortSymbolErrors. This counter is redundant in the sense that it is the summation of information already available through other objects. However, it is included specifically because the regular retrieval of this object as a means of tracking the health of a port provides a considerable optimization of network management traffic over the otherwise necessary retrieval of the summed counters. Note that rptrMonitorPortRunts is not included in this total; this is because runts usually indicate collision fragments, a normal network event. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.16,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the last of the following occurred: 1) the agent cold- or warm-started; 2) the row for the port was created (such as when a device or module was added to the system); or 3) any condition that would cause one of the counters for the row to experience a discontinuity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitor100PortTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Table of additional performance and error statistics for 100Mb/s ports, above and beyond those parameters that apply to both 10 and 100Mbps ports. Entries exist only for ports attached to 100Mbps repeaters. The columnar object rptrMonitorPortLastChange is used to indicate possible discontinuities of counter type columnar objects in this table.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortIsolates,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one each time that the repeater port automatically isolates as a consequence of false carrier events. The conditions which cause a port to automatically isolate are defined by the transition from the False Carrier state to the Link Unstable state of the carrier integrity state diagram (figure 27-9) [IEEE 802.3 Standard]. Note: Isolates do not affect the value of the PortOperStatus object. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2.1.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortSymbolErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one each time when valid length packet was received at the port and there was at least one occurrence of an invalid data symbol. This can increment only once per valid carrier event. A collision presence at any port of the repeater containing port N, will not cause this attribute to increment. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 7.4 hours at 100Mb/s.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2.1.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortUpper32Octets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This object is the number of octets contained in valid frames that have been received on this port, modulo 2**32. That is, it contains the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit octets counter, of which the lower 32 bits are contained in the rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets object. This two-counter mechanism is provided for those network management protocols that do not support 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMP V1) and are used to manage a repeater type of 100Mb/s. Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such that implementation of this object is not required in a system which does not support 100Mb/s. However, systems with mixed 10 and 100Mb/s ports may implement this object across all ports, including 10Mb/s. If this object is implemented, it must be according to the definition in the first paragraph of this description; that is, the value of this object MUST be a valid count. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortHCReadableOctets,Counter64,read-only,,current,,This object is the number of octets contained in valid frames that have been received on this port. This counter is incremented by OctetCount for each frame received on this port which has been determined to be a readable frame (i.e., including FCS octets but excluding framing bits and dribble bits). This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred. This counter is a 64-bit version of rptrMonitor- PortReadableOctets. It should be used by network management protocols which suppport 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMPv2). Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such that implementation of this object is not required in a system which does not support 100Mb/s.

If an implementation can not obtain a count of frames as seen by the repeater itself, this counter may be implemented as the summation of the values of the rptrMonitorPortReadableFrames counters for all of the ports in the repeater. This statistic provides one of the parameters necessary for obtaining the packet error rate. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 80 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.

This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter in a 10Mb/s repeater is 58 minutes divided by the number of ports in the repeater. For 100Mb/s repeaters processing traffic at a maximum rate, this counter can roll over in less than 6 minutes divided by the number of ports in the repeater. Since that amount of time could be less than a management station's poll cycle time, in order to avoid a loss of information a management station is advised to also poll the rptrMonUpper32TotalOctets object, or to use the 64-bit counter defined by rptrMonHCTotalOctets instead of the two 32-bit counters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMon100Table,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of additional information about each 100Mb/s repeater, augmenting the entries in the rptrMonTable. Entries exist in this table only for 100Mb/s repeaters. The columnar object rptrInfoLastChange is used to indicate possible discontinuities of counter type columnar objects in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.2.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMon100Entry,,not-accessible,rptrInfoId,current,,An entry in the table, containing information about a single 100Mbps repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.2.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonUpper32TotalOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets contained in the valid frames that have been received on the ports in this repeater, modulo 2**32. That is, it contains the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit counter, of which the lower 32 bits are contained in the rptrMonTotalOctets object. If an implementation can not obtain a count of octets as seen by the repeater itself, the 64-bit value may be the summation of the values of the rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets counters combined with the corresponding rptrMonitorPortUpper32Octets counters for all of the ports in the repeater. This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred within the repeater. This two-counter mechanism is provided for those network management protocols that do not support 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMP V1) and are used to manage a repeater type of 100Mb/s. Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such that implementation of this object is not required in a system which does not support 100Mb/s. However, systems with mixed 10 and 100Mb/s ports may implement this object across all ports, including 10Mb/s. If this object is implemented, it must be according to the definition in the first paragraph of this description; that is, the value of this object MUST be a valid count.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.2.1.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonHCTotalOctets,Counter64,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets contained in the valid frames that have been received on the ports in this group. If a implementation can not obtain a count of octets as seen by the repeater itself, this counter may be the summation of the values of the rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets counters for all of the ports in the group. This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred. This counter is a 64-bit (high-capacity) version of rptrMonUpper32TotalOctets and rptrMonTotalOctets. It should be used by network management protocols which support 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMPv2). Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such that implementation of this object is not required in a system which does not support 100Mb/s. However, systems with mixed 10 and 100Mb/s ports may implement this object across all ports, including 10Mb/s.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one entry per repeater in the system. It defines objects which allow a network management application to instruct an agent to watch for a given MAC address and report which port it was seen on. Only one address search can be in progress on each repeater at any one time. Before starting an address search, a management application should obtain 'ownership' of the entry in rptrAddrSearchTable for the repeater that is to perform the search. This is accomplished with the rptrAddrSearchLock and rptrAddrSearchStatus as follows: try_again: get(rptrAddrSearchLock, rptrAddrSearchStatus) while (rptrAddrSearchStatus != notInUse) { /* Loop waiting for objects to be available*/ short delay get(rptrAddrSearchLock, rptrAddrSearchStatus) } /* Try to claim map objects */ lock_value = rptrAddrSearchLock if ( set(rptrAddrSearchLock = lock_value, rptrAddrSearchStatus = inUse, rptrAddrSearchOwner = 'my-IP-address) == FAILURE) /* Another manager got the lock */ goto try_again /* I have the lock */ set (rptrAddrSearchAddress = <search target>) wait for rptrAddrSearchState to change from none if (rptrAddrSearchState == single) get (rptrAddrSearchGroup, rptrAddrSearchPort) /* release the lock, making sure not to overwrite anyone else's lock */ set (rptrAddrSearchLock = lock_value+1, rptrAddrSearchStatus = notInUse, rptrAddrSearchOwner = '') A management station first retrieves the values of the appropriate instances of the rptrAddrSearchLock and rptrAddrSearchStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of rptrAddrSearchStatus is 'notInUse'. The management station then tries to set the same instance of the rptrAddrSearchLock object to the value it just retrieved, the same instance of the rptrAddrSearchStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding instance of rptrAddrSearchOwner to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds, then the management station has obtained ownership of the rptrAddrSearchEntry, and the value of rptrAddrSearchLock is incremented by the agent (as per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the rptrAddrSearchEntry. Once ownership is obtained, the management station can proceed with the search operation. Note that the agent will reset rptrAddrSearchStatus to 'notInUse' if it has been in the 'inUse' state for an abnormally long period of time, to prevent a misbehaving manager from permanently locking the entry. It is suggested that this timeout period be between one and five minutes. When the management station has completed its search operation, it should free the entry by setting the instance of the rptrAddrSearchLock object to the previous value + 1, the instance of the rptrAddrSearchStatus to 'notInUse', and the instance of rptrAddrSearchOwner to a zero length string. This is done to prevent overwriting another station's lock.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchEntry,,not-accessible,rptrInfoId,current,,An entry containing objects for invoking an address search on a repeater.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1.1.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object is used to indicate that some management station is currently using this rptrAddrSearchEntry. Cooperating managers should set this object to 'notInUse' when they are finished using this entry. The agent will automatically set the value of this object to 'notInUse' if it has been set to 'inUse' for an unusually long period of time.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1.1.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchAddress,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is used to search for a specified MAC address. When this object is set, an address search begins. This automatically sets the corresponding instance of the rptrAddrSearchState object to 'none' and the corresponding instances of the rptrAddrSearchGroup and rptrAddrSearchPort objects to 0. When a valid frame is received by this repeater with a source MAC address which matches the current value of rptrAddrSearchAddress, the agent will update the corresponding instances of rptrAddrSearchState, rptrAddrSearchGroup and rptrAddrSearchPort to reflect the current status of the search, and the group and port on which the frame was seen.

This object is initialized to 'none' when the corresponding instance of rptrAddrSearchAddress is set. If the agent detects the address on exactly one port, it will set this object to 'single', and set the corresponding instances of rptrAddrSearchGroup and rptrAddrSearchPort to reflect the group and port on which the address was heard. If the agent detects the address on more than one port, it will set this object to 'multiple'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchGroup,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The group from which an error-free frame whose source address is equal to the corresponding instance of rptrAddrSearchAddress has been received.

This object has been deprecated because its value is undefined when no frames have been observed on this port. The replacement object is rptrAddrTrackNewLastSrcAddress.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.3.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrTrackSourceAddrChanges,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each time that the rptrAddrTrackLastSourceAddress attribute for this port has changed. This may indicate whether a link is connected to a single DTE or another multi-user segment. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 81 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.3.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrTrackNewLastSrcAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object is the SourceAddress of the last readable frame (i.e., counted by rptrMonitorPortReadableFrames) received by this port.

This value indicates to the maximum number of entries in the rptrExtAddrTrackTable relative to this port. If this object has the value of 1, the agent implements only the LastSourceAddress mechanism described by RFC 1368 or RFC 1516.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.3.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrExtAddrTrackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to extend the address tracking table (i.e., rptrAddrTrackTable) with a list of source MAC addresses that were recently received on each port. The number of ports is the same as the number of entries in table rptrPortTable. The number of entries in this table depends on the agent/repeater implementation and the number of different addresses received on each port. The first entry for each port contains the same MAC address that is given by the rptrAddrTrackNewLastSrcAddress for that port. Entries in this table for a particular port are retained when that port is switched from one repeater to another. The ordering of MAC addresses listed for a particular port is implementation dependent.

If the value of this object is positive, only ports assigned to this repeater will be used to form the list in which to order the Top N table. If this value is zero, all ports will be eligible for inclusion on the list. The value of this object may not be modified if the associated rptrTopNPortRowStatus object is equal to active(1). If, for a particular row in this table, the repeater specified by the value of this object goes away (is removed from the rptrInfoTable) while the associated rptrTopNPortRowStatus object is equal to active(1), the row in this table is preserved by the agent but the value of rptrTopNPortRowStatus is changed to notInService(2), and the agent may time out the row if appropriate. If the specified repeater comes back (reappears in the rptrInfoTable) before the row has been timed out, the management station must set the value of the rptrTopNPortRowStatus object back to active(1) if desired (the agent doesn't do this automatically).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report, which is loaded into the associated rptrTopNPortDuration object. When this object is set to a non-zero value, any associated rptrTopNPortEntries shall be made inaccessible by the agent. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. During this time, all associated rptrTopNPortEntries shall remain inaccessible. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the rptrTopNPortTable. Thus, the rptrTopNPort table needs to be created only at the end of the collection interval. If the value of this object is set to zero while the associated report is running, the running report is aborted and no associated rptrTopNPortEntries are created.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortDuration,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of seconds that this report has collected during the last sampling interval, or if this report is currently being collected, the number of seconds that this report is being collected during this sampling interval. When the associated rptrTopNPortTimeRemaining object is set, this object shall be set by the agent to the same value and shall not be modified until the next time the rptrTopNPortTimeRemaining is set. This value shall be zero if no reports have been requested for this rptrTopNPortControlEntry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.7,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of repeater ports in the top N table. When the associated rptrTopNPortRequestedSize object is created or modified, the agent should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The agent must not lower this value except as a result of a set to the associated rptrTopNPortRequestedSize object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.8,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this top N report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated rptrTopNPortTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report. If the report has not yet been started, the value of this object is zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.9,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of reports for the top `N' ports based on setting of associated control table entries. The maximum number of entries depends on the number of entries in table rptrTopNPortControlTable and the value of object rptrTopNPortGrantedSize for each entry. For each entry in the rptrTopNPortControlTable, repeater ports with the highest value of rptrTopNPortRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of that rate until there is no more room or until there are no more ports.

This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. Increasing values of rptrTopNPortIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of rptrTopNPortRate until index N is assigned to the entry with the lowest value of rptrTopNPortRate or there are no more rptrTopNPortEntries. No ports are included in a report where their value of rptrTopNPortRate would be zero.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::snmpRptrMod,,,,,,Management information for 802.3 repeaters. The following references are used throughout this MIB module: [IEEE 802.3 Std] refers to IEEE 802.3/ISO 8802-3 Information processing systems - Local area networks - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications (1993). [IEEE 802.3 Mgt] refers to IEEE 802.3u-1995, '10 Mb/s & 100 Mb/s Management, Section 30,' Supplement to ANSI/IEEE 802.3. The following terms are used throughout this MIB module. For complete formal definitions, the IEEE 802.3 standards should be consulted wherever possible: System - A managed entity compliant with this MIB, and incorporating at least one managed 802.3 repeater. Chassis - An enclosure for one managed repeater, part of a managed repeater, or several managed repeaters. It typically contains an integral power supply and a variable number of available module slots. Repeater-unit - The portion of the repeater set that is inboard of the physical media interfaces. The physical media interfaces (MAUs, AUIs) may be physically separated from the repeater-unit, or they may be integrated into the same physical package. Trivial repeater-unit - An isolated port that can gather statistics. Group - A recommended, but optional, entity defined by the IEEE 802.3 management standard, in order to support a modular numbering scheme. The classical example allows an implementor to represent field-replaceable units as groups of ports, with the port numbering matching the modular hardware implementation. System interconnect segment - An internal segment allowing interconnection of ports belonging to different physical entities into the same logical manageable repeater. Examples of implementation might be backplane busses in modular hubs, or chaining cables in stacks of hubs. Stack - A scalable system that may include managed repeaters, in which modularity is achieved by interconnecting a number of different chassis. Module - A building block in a modular chassis. It typically maps into one 'slot'; however, the range of configurations may be very large, with several modules entering one slot, or one module covering several slots.

This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface as named by the device, then each will have the same value of ifName. Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP queries concerning an interface on some other (proxied) device, then the value of ifName for such an interface is the proxied device's local name for it. If there is no local name, or this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1,IF-MIB::ifTestEntry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,An entry containing objects for invoking tests on an interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.1,IF-MIB::ifTestId,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,This object identifies the current invocation of the interface's test.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.6,IF-MIB::ifTestOwner,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The entity which currently has the 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains an entry for each address (broadcast, multicast, or uni-cast) for which the system will receive packets/frames on a particular interface, except as follows: - for an interface operating in promiscuous mode, entries are only required for those addresses for which the system would receive frames were it not operating in promiscuous mode. - for 802.5 functional addresses, only one entry is required, for the address which has the functional address bit ANDed with the bit mask of all functional addresses for which the interface will accept frames. A system is normally able to use any unicast address which corresponds to an entry in this table as a source address.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.3,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3),This object has the value nonVolatile(3) for those entries in the table which are valid and will not be deleted by the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value volatile(2) are valid and exist, but have not been saved, so that will not exist after the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value other(1) are valid and exist but are not classified as to whether they will continue to exist after the next restart.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTableLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last creation or deletion of an entry in the ifTable.

The reading of this object should have a value of 'active(1)'. For creation of new entry, a management application should set this object with value 'createAndGo(4)', and using the same value as that got from reading object 'atNtpPeerIndexNext', as the index for the new entry. When an entry is created, the object 'atNtpPeerNameAddr' in the entry is set with a default value '0.0.0.0'. The management application should change it to a desired value with a SET operation. The management application may need to take additional SET operations to set values for other objects, to ensure they have desired values. For deletion of entry, a management application should set this object with value 'destroy(6)'. Once an entry is deleted, other entries in the table which have bigger index than the deleted one, will be indexed again. Therefore a management application can effectively delete multiple entries by repeating the SET operation using the same index.

This mode is intended for use with non Wi-Fi Multimedia Enabled (non-WME) clients and is disabled by default. When this object is set to enable(1), both the voice and video access categories are accessible by wireless clients that do not have an admitted TSPEC, which can lead to underestimation of the available medium time by wireless TSPEC admission control. Use caution when enabling this mode and also consider using very small ACM limit values as well.

This is referred to as units of 32 usec-per-sec and is generally treated as an average value, with any over-usage in one interval deducted from the alotted medium time for the next interval.

The actual measure of 'appreciably exceeded' is implementation-dependent, but it is not necessarily a single occurrence of exceeding the medium time for any given one second interval. Rather, this event may be indicated after repeated violations of the medium time over some measurement interval, and is intended as an heuristic to identify a wireless client whose TSPEC medium time may be set too low relative to its actual traffic stream requirements. This object reflects the number of excess usage events that have accumulated, but have not been reported, through the Trap Manager, with such reporting enabled by the wsTspecTrapMode object. Whenever a trap report is generated for this event, the value of this object restarts counting from zero.
