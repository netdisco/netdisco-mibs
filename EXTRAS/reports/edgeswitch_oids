.1.3.6.1.2.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::system,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2,SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3,SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4,SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person. If no contact information is known, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5,SNMPv2-MIB::sysName,OCTET,read-write,,current,,An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6,SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone closet, 3rd floor'). If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

Additional values for ifType are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), through updating the syntax of the IANAifType textual convention.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8,IF-MIB::ifOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3):unknown(4):dormant(5):notPresent(6):lowerLayerDown(7),The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,IF-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10,IF-MIB::ifInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11,IF-MIB::ifInUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,IF-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,IF-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17,IF-MIB::ifOutUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.18,IF-MIB::ifOutNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.21,IF-MIB::ifOutQLen,Gauge32,read-only,,deprecated,,The length of the output packet queue (in packets).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType. If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available, the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.3,RFC1213-MIB::ipInReceives,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of input datagrams received from interfaces, including those received in error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.4,RFC1213-MIB::ipInHdrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams discarded due to errors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IP options, etc.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipInAddrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams discarded because the IP address in their IP header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space). Note that this counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly.

Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.

Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.

Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipRouteType object.

For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0. It should be noted that all IP routing subsystems implicitly use this mechanism.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric5,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,RFC1213-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.8.5.1.15,RFC1213-MIB::egpNeighEventTrigger,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,start(1):stop(2),A control variable used to trigger operator- initiated Start and Stop events. When read, this variable always returns the most recent value that egpNeighEventTrigger was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the node, it returns a value of `stop'. When set, this variable causes a Start or Stop event on the specified neighbor, as specified on pages 8-10 of RFC 904. Briefly, a Start event causes an Idle peer to begin neighbor acquisition and a non-Idle peer to reinitiate neighbor acquisition. A stop event causes a non-Idle peer to return to the Idle state until a Start event occurs, either via egpNeighEventTrigger or otherwise.

Also, implementations which authenticate community-based SNMP messages using check(s) in addition to matching the community name (for example, by also checking whether the message originated from a transport address allowed to use a specified community name) MAY include in this value the number of messages which failed the additional check(s). It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any security model which is used to authenticate community-based SNMP messages specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value.

The precise conditions under which this counter is incremented (if at all) depend on how the SNMP entity implements its access control mechanism and how its applications interact with that access control mechanism. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any access control mechanism which is used to control access to and visibility of MIB instrumentation specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsEntry,,not-accessible,etherStatsIndex,current,,A collection of statistics kept for a particular Ethernet interface. As an example, an instance of the etherStatsPkts object might be named etherStatsPkts.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies this etherStats entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data that this etherStats entry is configured to analyze. This source can be any ethernet interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated etherStatsStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped; it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets). This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of 10-Megabit ethernet utilization. If greater precision is desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects should be sampled before and after a common interval. The differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets, respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is Interval. These values are used to calculate the Utilization as follows: Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8) Utilization = ------------------------------------- Interval * 10,000 The result of this equation is the value Utilization which is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a scale of 0 to 100 percent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherStatsPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets (including bad packets, broadcast packets, and multicast packets) received.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::etherStatsBroadcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of good packets received that were directed to the broadcast address. Note that this does not include multicast packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::etherStatsMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of good packets received that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets directed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that had a length (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) of between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherStatsUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherStatsFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherStatsFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherStatsJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.14,RMON-MIB::etherStatsPkts64Octets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets (including bad packets) received that were 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlEntry,,not-accessible,historyControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic sampling of statistics. As an example, an instance of the historyControlInterval object might be named historyControlInterval.2
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the historyControl table. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for an interface on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::historyControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for which historical data was collected and placed in a media-specific table on behalf of this historyControlEntry. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set historyControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. DEFVAL { 50 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the media-specific table. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated media- specific entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::historyControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table. For example, on an Ethernet network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum utilization. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::historyControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same historyControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that had a length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) but were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherHistoryFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.14,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment during this sampling interval. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.15,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUtilization,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the mean physical layer network utilization on this interface during this sampling interval, in hundredths of a percent.

If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.4.1.3,TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB::tokenRingPHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,mandatory,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.4.1.4,TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB::tokenRingPHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3,RMON-MIB::alarm,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1,RMON-MIB::alarmTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of alarm entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmEntry,,not-accessible,alarmIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic checking for alarm conditions. For example, an instance of the alarmValue object might be named alarmValue.8
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alarm table. Each such entry defines a diagnostic sample at a particular interval for an object on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::alarmInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared with the rising and falling thresholds. When setting this variable, care should be taken in the case of deltaValue sampling - the interval should be set short enough that the sampled variable is very unlikely to increase or decrease by more than 2^31 - 1 during a single sampling interval. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::alarmVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4). This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::alarmSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::alarmValue,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of the statistic during the last sampling period. For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::alarmStartupAlarm,INTEGER,read-create,,current,risingAlarm(1):fallingAlarm(2):risingOrFallingAlarm(3),The alarm that may be sent when this entry is first set to valid. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is less than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was greater than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a falling event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value rises above this threshold and reaches the alarmRisingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a rising threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::alarmOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::alarmStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this alarm entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hostControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up the discovery of hosts on a particular interface and the collection of statistics about these hosts. For example, an instance of the hostControlTableSize object might be named hostControlTableSize.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostControl table. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable on behalf of this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for this instance of the host function. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated hostControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostControlTableSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of hostEntries in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable associated with this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostControlLastDeleteTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the last entry was deleted from the portion of the hostTable associated with this hostControlEntry. If no deletions have occurred, this value shall be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this hostControl entry. If this object is not equal to valid(1), all associated entries in the hostTable, hostTimeTable, and the hostTopNTable shall be deleted by the agent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2,RMON-MIB::hostTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of host entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1,RMON-MIB::hostEntry,,not-accessible,hostIndex:hostAddress,current,,A collection of statistics for a particular host that has been discovered on an interface of this device. For example, an instance of the hostOutBroadcastPkts object might be named hostOutBroadcastPkts.1.6.8.0.32.27.3.176

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that defines the relative ordering of the creation time of hosts captured for a particular hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. It is important to note that the order for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostInPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted to this address since it was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostOutPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets, including bad packets, transmitted by this address since it was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets transmitted to this address since it was added to the hostTable (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), except for those octets in bad packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::hostOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets transmitted by this address since it was added to the hostTable (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), including those octets in bad packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::hostOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of bad packets transmitted by this address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::hostOutBroadcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to the broadcast address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::hostOutMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to a multicast address since this host was added to the hostTable. Note that this number does not include packets directed to the broadcast address.

This collection includes the relative ordering of the creation time of this object. For example, an instance of the hostTimeOutBroadcastPkts object might be named hostTimeOutBroadcastPkts.1.687
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostTimeAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The physical address of this host.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostTimeCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostTime table among those entries associated with the same hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a download of the table may have missed entries, and where a previous association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostTimeIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::filterPktData,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The data that is to be matched with the input packet. For each packet received, this filter and the accompanying filterPktDataMask and filterPktDataNotMask will be adjusted for the offset. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktDataMask bit equal to one. The following three rules are then applied to every packet: (1) If the packet is too short and does not have data corresponding to part of the filterPktData, the packet will fail this data match. (2) For each relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. (3) If for every relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. Any packets that have not failed any of the three matches above have passed this data match. In particular, a zero length filter will match any packet. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the match algorithm. The offset is applied to filterPktDataMask in the same way it is applied to the filter. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataNotMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktData object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktData object. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatus,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. In particular, a zero length status filter will match any packet's status. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined. For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object, this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the status match process. Only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the status match algorithm. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the size of the filterPktStatus. In addition, if a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusNotMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the status match process. Those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object or a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the longer of the lengths of the filterPktStatus object and the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).

Each such entry defines one channel, a logical data and event stream. It is suggested that before creating a channel, an application should scan all instances of the filterChannelIndex object to make sure that there are no pre-existing filters that would be inadvertently be linked to the channel.

The interface identified by a particular value of this object is the same interface as identified by the same value of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17]. The filters in this group are applied to all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry.

If this object is equal to acceptMatched(1), packets will be accepted to this channel if they are accepted by both the packet data and packet status matches of an associated filter. If this object is equal to acceptFailed(2), packets will be accepted to this channel only if they fail either the packet data match or the packet status match of each of the associated filters. In particular, a channel with no associated filters will match no packets if set to acceptMatched(1) case and will match all packets in the acceptFailed(2) case.

The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOnEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOffEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from on to off when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOffEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::channelEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to be generated when the associated channelDataControl is on and a packet is matched. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::channelEventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,eventReady(1):eventFired(2):eventAlwaysReady(3),The event status of this channel. If this channel is configured to generate events when packets are matched, a means of controlling the flow of those events is often needed. When this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single event may be generated, after which this object will be set by the probe to eventFired(2). While in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be generated until the object is modified to eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)). The management station can thus easily respond to a notification of an event by re-enabling this object. If the management station wishes to disable this flow control and allow events to be generated at will, this object may be set to eventAlwaysReady(3). Disabling the flow control is discouraged as it can result in high network traffic or other performance problems. DEFVAL { eventReady }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::channelMatches,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times this channel has matched a packet. Note that this object is updated even when channelDataControl is set to off.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::channelDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::channelCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4,RMON2-MIB::filter2Table,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1,RMON2-MIB::filter2Entry,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirDataLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with performs the following operations on every packet: 1) If the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by this object, discard the packet and exit (i.e., discard the packet if it is not of the identified protocol). 2) If the associated filterProtocolDirLocalIndex is non-zero and the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by that object, discard the packet and exit. 3) If the packet matches, perform the regular filter algorithm as if the beginning of this named protocol is the beginning of the packet, potentially applying the filterOffset value to move further into the packet. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with will discard the packet if the packet doesn't match this protocol directory entry. DEFVAL { 0 }

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of buffers control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlEntry,,not-accessible,bufferControlIndex,current,,A set of parameters that control the collection of a stream of packets that have matched filters. As an example, an instance of the bufferControlCaptureSliceSize object might be named bufferControlCaptureSliceSize.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the bufferControl table. The value of this index shall never be zero. Each such entry defines one set of packets that is captured and controlled by one or more filters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::bufferControlChannelIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,An index that identifies the channel that is the source of packets for this bufferControl table. The channel identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,spaceAvailable(1):full(2),This object shows whether the buffer has room to accept new packets or if it is full. If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is accepting new packets normally. If the status is full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets to make room for new ones as they arrive. Otherwise, if the status is full(2) and the bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull, then the buffer has stopped collecting packets. When this object is set to full(2) the probe must not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the case of a significant gain in resources such as an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted. In particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old packets to make room for newly arrived packets must not affect the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullAction,INTEGER,read-create,,current,lockWhenFull(1):wrapWhenFull(2),Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status. When in the lockWhenFull(1) state and a packet is added to the buffer that fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCaptureSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet that will be saved in this capture buffer. For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by the probe and this object is set to 500, then only 500 octets of the packet will be stored in the associated capture buffer. If this variable is set to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer, the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain only the first 100 octets of the packet. A prudent manager will take into account possible interoperability or fragmentation problems that may occur if the download slice size is set too large. In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484 octets, although they are encouraged to support larger datagrams whenever feasible. DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset of the first octet of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain bytes starting 100 octets into the packet. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested maximum number of octets to be saved in this captureBuffer, including any implementation-specific overhead. If this variable is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the object has the special value of -1, the probe must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1. DEFVAL { -1 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of octets that can be saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead. If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as possible. When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the request object has the special value of -1, the probe must set this object to -1. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object. When this maximum number of octets is reached and a new packet is to be added to this capture buffer and the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2), enough of the oldest packets associated with this capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so that the new packet can be added. If the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1), the new packet shall be discarded. In either case, the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to full(2). When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the captureBufferTable associated with this bufferControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be deleted by the agent so that the number of octets used remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCapturedPackets,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets currently in this captureBuffer.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTurnOnTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this capture buffer was first turned on.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::bufferControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::bufferControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this buffer Control Entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::captureBufferIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the captureBuffer table associated with a particular bufferControlEntry. This index will start at 1 and increase by one for each new packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex. Should this value reach 2147483647, the next packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex shall cause this value to wrap around to 1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketID,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that describes the order of packets that are received on a particular interface. The packetID of a packet captured on an interface is defined to be greater than the packetID's of all packets captured previously on the same interface. As the captureBufferPacketID object has a maximum positive value of 2^31 - 1, any captureBufferPacketID object shall have the value of the associated packet's packetID mod 2^31.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketData,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The data inside the packet, starting at the beginning of the packet plus any offset specified in the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset, including any link level headers. The length of the data in this object is the minimum of the length of the captured packet minus the offset, the length of the associated bufferControlCaptureSliceSize minus the offset, and the associated bufferControlDownloadSliceSize. If this minimum is less than zero, this object shall have a length of zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketLength,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The actual length (off the wire) of the packet stored in this entry, including FCS octets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketTime,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of milliseconds that had passed since this capture buffer was first turned on when this packet was captured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketStatus,Integer32,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the error status of this packet. The value of this object is defined in the same way as filterPktStatus. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error 3 First packet in this capture buffer after it was detected that some packets were not processed correctly. 4 Packet's order in buffer is only approximate (May only be set for packets sent from the probe) For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined.

In the case of log, an entry is made in the log table for each event. In the case of snmp-trap, an SNMP trap is sent to one or more management stations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::eventCommunity,OCTET,read-create,,current,,If an SNMP trap is to be sent, it will be sent to the SNMP community specified by this octet string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::eventLastTimeSent,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this event entry last generated an event. If this entry has not generated any events, this value will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::eventOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it. If this object contains a string starting with 'monitor' and has associated entries in the log table, all connected management stations should retrieve those log entries, as they may have significance to all management stations connected to this device
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::eventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this event entry. If this object is not equal to valid(1), all associated log entries shall be deleted by the agent.

These indexes are assigned beginning with 1 and increase by one with each new log entry. The association between values of logIndex and logEntries is fixed for the lifetime of each logEntry. The agent may choose to delete the oldest instances of logEntry as required because of lack of memory. It is an implementation-specific matter as to when this deletion may occur.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11,RMON2-MIB::protocolDir,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the protocol directory was last modified, either through insertions or deletions, or through modifications of the protocolDirAddressMapConfig, protocolDirHostConfig, or protocolDirMatrixConfig.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table lists the protocols that this agent has the capability to decode and count. There is one entry in this table for each such protocol. These protocols represent different network-layer, transport-layer, and higher-layer protocols. The agent should boot up with this table preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and wishes to monitor. Implementations are strongly encouraged to support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for the protocol distribution group), even for implementations that don't support the application-layer groups.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDirID:protocolDirParameters,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDirTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the encoding of a length of 8, followed by 8 subids encoding the protocolDirID of 1.2048, followed by a length of 2 and the 2 subids encoding zero-valued parameters. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A unique identifier for a particular protocol. Standard identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e., a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC 2074 for more details. Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect. In other words, it need not populate this table with all possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on the fly when it sees them. Whether it does these things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit, usability) and is up to the designer of the product. If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that the agent doesn't understand, either directly or algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirParameters,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters for the associated protocolDirID. See the associated RMON2 Protocol Identifiers document for a description of the possible parameters. There will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the protocolDirID. Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of parameters for a node is optional). The proper parameter value for each node is included in this string. Note that the inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is not optional. What is optional is that a node may have no parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that node will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The locally arbitrary but unique identifier associated with this protocolDir entry. The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the next agent restart in the event that the protocol directory entry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A textual description of the protocol encapsulation. A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the entire encapsulation (e.g., only the highest layer). This object is intended for human consumption only. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirType,BITS,read-only,,current,extensible(0):addressRecognitionCapable(1),This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol directory entry. The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes whether this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is 'ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built-in support), that child node is not extendable. This is termed 'limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network-level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirAddressMapConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for address mapping for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol. When an entry is created in this table by a management operation as part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting addresses of the extended protocols. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not perform address mapping for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured to perform address mapping for this protocol for all addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol but is configured to not perform address mapping for this protocol for any addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the addressMappingTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirHostConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both the nlHostTable and the alHostTable. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol and is configured to track both tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable. Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirMatrixConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are implemented but don't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for this protocol for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables. Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable, nlMatrixSDTable, nlMatrixDSTable, alHostTable, alMatrixSDTable, and alMatrixDSTable shall be deleted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics tables. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of protocol statistics is available. Rationale: This table controls collection of very basic statistics for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface. An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by different protocols. A media-specific statistics collection could also be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistControlDroppedFrames.7

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the this protocol distribution. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDistControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the protocolDistStatsTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry is made in this table for every protocol in the protocolDirTable that has been seen in at least one packet. Counters are updated in this table for every protocol type that is encountered when parsing a packet, but no counters are updated for packets with MAC-layer errors. Note that if a protocolDirEntry is deleted, all associated entries in this table are removed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex:protocolDirLocalIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistStatsTable. The index is composed of the protocolDistControlIndex of the associated protocolDistControlEntry, followed by the protocolDirLocalIndex of the associated protocol that this entry represents. In other words, the index identifies the protocol distribution an entry is a part of and the particular protocol that it represents. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistStatsPkts.1.18
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type received without errors. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type received since it was added to the protocolDistStatsTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), except for those octets in packets that contained errors.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been inserted into the addressMapTable. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been deleted from the addressMapTable (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the addressMapTable. The probe will not create more than this number of entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to control the collection of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. Note that this is not like the typical RMON controlTable and dataTable in which each entry creates its own data table. Each entry in this table enables the discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement of address mappings into the central addressMapTable. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of address mappings is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapControlDroppedFrames.1

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the addressMapTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. The probe will add entries to this table based on the source MAC and network addresses seen in packets without MAC-level errors. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirAddressMapConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirAddressMapConfig value of supportedOff(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:addressMapNetworkAddress:addressMapSource,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapTable. The protocolDirLocalIndex in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the addressMapNetworkAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapSource.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.11.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapNetworkAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this relation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of ip, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapSource,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The interface or port on which the associated network address was most recently seen. If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this object shall identify the instance of the rptrGroupPortIndex object, defined in [RFC2108], for the desired port. For example, if an entry were to receive data from group #1, port #1, this object would be set to rptrGroupPortIndex.1.1. Note that while the dataSource associated with this entry may only point to index objects, this object may at times point to repeater port objects. This situation occurs when the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally attached repeater and the agent has additional information about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The last source physical address on which the associated network address was seen. If the protocol of the associated network address was encapsulated inside of a network-level or higher protocol, this will be the address of the next-lower protocol with the addressRecognitionCapable bit enabled and will be formatted as specified for that protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) host table control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level host tables indexed by network addresses. Both the network- and application-level host tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer host records in memory, it can derive network-layer host records from them.) Entries in the nlHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alHostTable, entries in the alHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of host statistics is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlHostControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hlHostControlTable. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlHostTable, and optionally in the alHostTable, on behalf of this hlHostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the associated host tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for the associated nlHost entries for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlHostTable is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been inserted into the nlHost table. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been deleted from the nlHost table (for any reason).

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The addition of a conversation into both the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two insertions (even though every addition into one table must be accompanied by an insertion into the other). To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the sum of then nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable sizes can be determined by subtracting hlMatrixControlNlDeletes from hlMatrixControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlMatrix entry has been deleted from the nlMatrix tables (for any reason).

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlMatrixControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the alMatrixTables are not implemented or are inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0.

This table is indexed first by the source address and then by the destination address to make it convenient to collect all conversations from a particular address. The probe will populate this table for all network layer protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirMatrixConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirMatrixConfig value of supportedOff(2).

This object may not be modified if the associated nlMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1). If this value is less than or equal to 2, when the report is prepared, entries are created in the nlMatrixTopNTable associated with this object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated nlMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the nlMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries.

In other words, this is the time that the associated nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.

This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixSDTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of application traffic matrix entries that collect statistics for conversations of a particular protocol between two network-level addresses. This table is indexed first by the source address and then by the destination address to make it convenient to collect all statistics from a particular address. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirMatrixConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirMatrixConfig value of supportedOff(2). The probe will add to this table all pairs of addresses for all protocols seen in all packets with no MAC errors and will increment octet and packet counts in the table for all packets with no MAC errors. Further, entries will only be added to this table if their address pair exists in the nlMatrixSDTable and will be deleted from this table if the address pair is deleted from the nlMatrixSDTable.

The values alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts, alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets, alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityOctets cause collection only from protocols that have no child protocols that are counted. The values alMatrixTopNAllPkts, alMatrixTopNAllOctets, alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityOctets cause collection from all alMatrix entries.

When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated alMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the alMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there. When this object is modified by the management station, any associated entries in the alMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of alMatrixTopNPktRate or alMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted. It is also an implementation-specific matter as to whether zero-valued entries are available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this topN report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started.

This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNSourceAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the source host in this conversation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNDestAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the destination host in this conversation.

(Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDPkts object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNPktRate, and not on the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the source host to the destination host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixSDOctets object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a group of user-defined MIB objects to be sampled periodically (called a bucket-group). For example, an instance of usrHistoryControlInterval might be named usrHistoryControlInterval.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the usrHistoryControlTable. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for a specified set of MIB instances available from the managed system.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlObjects,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of MIB objects to be collected in the portion of usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry.

DEFVAL { 50 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object. The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object should be set before or at the same time as this object to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources required for this usrHistoryControlEntry. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable, the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated usrHistory entries may be allowed to grow.

Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and to set the usrHistoryControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index used to uniquely identify an entry in the usrHistoryObject table. Each such entry defines a MIB instance to be collected periodically.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the user history mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more information. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable for storage in the usrHistoryTable. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be copied directly into the history bucket. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference will be stored in the history bucket. If the associated usrHistoryObjectVariable instance could not be obtained at the previous sample interval, then a delta sample is not possible, and the value of the associated usrHistoryValStatus object for this interval will be valueNotAvailable(1). This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of user-defined history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistorySampleIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A historical sample of user-defined variables. This sample is associated with the usrHistoryControlEntry that set up the parameters for a regular collection of these samples. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The usrHistoryObjectIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryObjectEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. For example, an instance of usrHistoryAbsValue, which represents the 14th sample of a variable collected as specified by usrHistoryControlEntry.1 and usrHistoryObjectEntry.1.5, would be named usrHistoryAbsValue.1.14.5
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same usrHistoryControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample that is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.

The value determines how long the port stays in each of the Listening and Learning states, which precede the Forwarding state. This value is also used when a topology change has been detected and is underway, to age all dynamic entries in the Forwarding Database. [Note that this value is the one that this bridge is currently using, in contrast to dot1dStpBridgeForwardDelay, which is the value that this bridge and all others would start using if/when this bridge were to become the root.]

If this counter is increasing, it indicates that the Forwarding Database is regularly becoming full (a condition that has unpleasant performance effects on the subnetwork). If this counter has a significant value but is not presently increasing, it indicates that the problem has been occurring but is not persistent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.2,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dTpAgingTime,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The timeout period in seconds for aging out dynamically-learned forwarding information. 802.1D-1998 recommends a default of 300 seconds.

This table is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least-significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.6.1,P-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dTpPortOverflowEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dTpPort,current,,The most significant bits of statistics counters for a high- capacity interface of a transparent bridge.

The value of zero in this table, as the port number from which frames with a specific destination address are received, is used to specify all ports for which there is no specific entry in this table for that particular destination address. Entries are valid for unicast and for group/broadcast addresses.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.5.1.1,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dStaticEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dStaticAddress:dot1dStaticReceivePort,current,,Filtering information configured into the bridge by (local or network) management specifying the set of ports to which frames received from a specific port and containing a specific destination address are allowed to be forwarded.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.5.1.1.1,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dStaticAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The destination MAC address in a frame to which this entry's filtering information applies. This object can take the value of a unicast address, a group address, or the broadcast address.

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2). SNMP engines on bridges supporting a large number of ports must support appropriate maximum message sizes.

Separate objects are provided for both the most-significant and least-significant bits of statistics counters for ports that are associated with this transparent bridge. The most-significant bit objects are only required on high-capacity interfaces, as defined in the conformance clauses for these objects. This mechanism is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least- significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.

This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface as named by the device, then each will have the same value of ifName. Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP queries concerning an interface on some other (proxied) device, then the value of ifName for such an interface is the proxied device's local name for it.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.
