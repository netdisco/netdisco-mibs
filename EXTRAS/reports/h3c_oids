.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The interval at which LLDP frames are transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent. The default value for lldpMessageTxInterval object is 30 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 30 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The time-to-live value expressed as a multiple of the lldpMessageTxInterval object. The actual time-to-live value used in LLDP frames, transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent, can be expressed by the following formula: TTL = min(65535, (lldpMessageTxInterval * lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier)) For example, if the value of lldpMessageTxInterval is '30', and the value of lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier is '4', then the value '120' is encoded in the TTL field in the LLDP header. The default value for lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier object is 4. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 4 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpReinitDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpReinitDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) from when lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object of a particular port becomes 'disabled' until re-initialization will be attempted. The default value for lldpReintDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 2 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpTxDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpTxDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) between successive LLDP frame transmissions  initiated by value/status changes in the LLDP local systems MIB. The recommended value for the lldpTxDelay is set by the following formula: 1 <= lldpTxDelay <= (0.25 * lldpMessageTxInterval) The default value for lldpTxDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 2 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.5,LLDP-MIB::lldpNotificationInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,This object controls the transmission of LLDP notifications. the agent must not generate more than one lldpRemTablesChange notification-event in the indicated period, where a 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single notification PDU type to a list of notification destinations. If additional changes in lldpRemoteSystemsData object groups occur within the indicated throttling period, then these trap- events must be suppressed by the agent. An NMS should periodically check the value of lldpStatsRemTableLastChangeTime to detect any missed lldpRemTablesChange notification-events, e.g. due to throttling or transmission loss. If notification transmission is enabled for particular ports, the suggested default throttling period is 5 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 5 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls LLDP frame transmission on individual ports.

If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txOnly(1)', then LLDP agent will transmit LLDP frames on this port and it will not store any information about the remote systems connected.  If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'rxOnly(2)', then the LLDP agent will receive, but it will not transmit LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txAndRx(3)', then the LLDP agent will transmit and receive LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'disabled(4)', then LLDP agent will not transmit or receive LLDP frames on this port. If there is remote systems information which is received on this port and stored in other tables, before the port's lldpPortConfigAdminStatus becomes disabled, then the information will naturally age out. DEFVAL { txAndRx }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),The lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable controls, on a per port basis, whether or not notifications from the agent are enabled.

Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a TLV type associated with a specific optional TLV. It should be noted that the organizationally-specific TLVs are excluded from the lldpTLVsTxEnable bitmap.  LLDP Organization Specific Information Extension MIBs should have similar configuration object to control transmission of their organizationally defined TLVs. The bit 'portDesc(0)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'Port Description TLV'. The bit 'sysName(1)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Name TLV'. The bit 'sysDesc(2)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Description TLV'. The bit 'sysCap(3)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Capabilities TLV'. There is no bit reserved for the management address TLV type since transmission of management address TLVs are controlled by another object, lldpConfigManAddrTable. The default value for lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable object is empty set, which means no enumerated values are set. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { { } }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls selection of LLDP management address TLV instances to be transmitted on individual ports.

This configuration object augments the lldpLocManAddrEntry, therefore it is only present along with the management address instance contained in the associated lldpLocManAddrEntry entry. Each active lldpConfigManAddrEntry must be restored from non-volatile and re-created (along with the corresponding lldpLocManAddrEntry) after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable,OCTET,read-write,,current,,A set of ports that are identified by a PortList, in which each port is represented as a bit. The corresponding local system management address instance will be transmitted on the member ports of the lldpManAddrPortsTxEnable.  The default value for lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable object is empty binary string, which means no ports are specified for advertising indicated management address instance. DEFVAL { 0 }

An NMS can use this object to reduce polling of the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesInserts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been inserted into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. The complete set of information received from a particular MSAP should be inserted into related tables. If partial information cannot be inserted for a reason such as lack of resources, all of the complete set of information should be removed. This counter should be incremented only once after the complete set of information is successfully recorded in all related tables. Any failures during inserting information set which result in deletion of previously inserted information should not trigger any changes in lldpStatsRemTablesInserts since the insert is not completed yet or or in lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes, since the deletion would only be a partial deletion. If the failure was the result of lack of resources, the lldpStatsRemTablesDrops counter should be incremented once.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely deleted from all related tables. Partial deletions, such as deletion of rows associated with a particular MSAP from some tables, but not from all tables are not allowed, thus should not change the value of this counter.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDrops,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP could not be entered into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because of insufficient resources.

This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely invalidated (aged out) from all related tables. Partial aging, similar to deletion case, is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.

The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.

The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.

An unrecognized TLV is referred to as the TLV whose type value is in the range of reserved TLV types (000 1001 - 111 1110) in Table 9.1 of IEEE Std 802.1AB-2005. An unrecognized TLV may be a basic management TLV from a later LLDP version.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The counter that represents the number of age-outs that occurred on a given port. An age-out is the number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because the information timeliness interval has expired. This counter is similar to lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts, except that the counter is on a per port basis. This enables NMS to poll tables associated with the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems on the indicated port only. This counter should be set to zero during agent initialization and its value should not be saved in non-volatile storage. When a port's admin status changes from 'disabled' to 'rxOnly', 'txOnly' or 'txAndRx', the counter associated with the same port should reset to 0. The agent should also flush all remote system information associated with the same port. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is invalidated (aged out) from all related tables on a particular port. Partial aging is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.4.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpRemTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one or more rows per physical network connection known to this agent. The agent may wish to ensure that only one lldpRemEntry is present for each local port, or it may choose to maintain multiple lldpRemEntries for the same local port. The following procedure may be used to retrieve remote systems information updates from an LLDP agent: 1. NMS polls all tables associated with remote systems and keeps a local copy of the information retrieved. NMS polls periodically the values of the following objects: a. lldpStatsRemTablesInserts b. lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes c. lldpStatsRemTablesDrops d. lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts e. lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal for all ports. 2. LLDP agent updates remote systems MIB objects, and sends out notifications to a list of notification destinations. 3. NMS receives the notifications and compares the new values of objects listed in step 1.  Periodically, NMS should poll the object lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime to find out if anything has changed since the last poll. if something has changed, NMS will poll the objects listed in step 1 to figure out what kind of changes occurred in the tables. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesInserts has changed, then NMS will walk all tables by employing TimeFilter with the last-polled time value. This request will return new objects or objects whose values are updated since the last poll. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts has changed, then NMS will walk the lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal and compare the new values with previously recorded ones. For ports whose lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal value is greater than the recorded value, NMS will have to retrieve objects associated with those ports from table(s) without employing a TimeFilter (which is performed by specifying 0 for the TimeFilter.) lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes and lldpStatsRemTablesDrops objects are provided for informational purposes.

This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8,IF-MIB::ifOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3):unknown(4):dormant(5):notPresent(6):lowerLayerDown(7),The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,IF-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10,IF-MIB::ifInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11,IF-MIB::ifInUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,IF-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,IF-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType. If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available, the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.

This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space). Note that this counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.9,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDelivers,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of input datagrams successfully delivered to IP user-protocols (including ICMP).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.10,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutRequests,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of IP datagrams which local IP user-protocols (including ICMP) supplied to IP in requests for transmission. Note that this counter does not include any datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams.

Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.13,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmTimeout,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The maximum number of seconds which received fragments are held while they are awaiting reassembly at this entity.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.16,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of failures detected by the IP re- assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc). Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms (notably the algorithm in RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.17,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragOKs,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been successfully fragmented at this entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.18,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been discarded because they needed to be fragmented at this entity but could not be, e.g., because their Don't Fragment flag was set.

For example, when the Internet standard all-ones broadcast address is used, the value will be 1. This value applies to both the subnet and network broadcasts addresses used by the entity on this (logical) interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteDest,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,The destination IP address of this route. An entry with a value of 0.0.0.0 is considered a default route. Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.

Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use.

For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0.

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,RFC1213-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsEntry,,not-accessible,etherStatsIndex,current,,A collection of statistics kept for a particular Ethernet interface. As an example, an instance of the etherStatsPkts object might be named etherStatsPkts.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies this etherStats entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data that this etherStats entry is configured to analyze. This source can be any ethernet interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated etherStatsStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped; it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets). This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of 10-Megabit ethernet utilization. If greater precision is desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects should be sampled before and after a common interval. The differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets, respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is Interval. These values are used to calculate the Utilization as follows: Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8) Utilization = ------------------------------------- Interval * 10,000 The result of this equation is the value Utilization which is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a scale of 0 to 100 percent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherStatsPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets (including bad packets, broadcast packets, and multicast packets) received.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::etherStatsBroadcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of good packets received that were directed to the broadcast address. Note that this does not include multicast packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::etherStatsMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of good packets received that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets directed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that had a length (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) of between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherStatsUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherStatsFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherStatsFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherStatsJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlEntry,,not-accessible,historyControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic sampling of statistics. As an example, an instance of the historyControlInterval object might be named historyControlInterval.2
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the historyControl table. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for an interface on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::historyControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for which historical data was collected and placed in a media-specific table on behalf of this historyControlEntry. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set historyControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. DEFVAL { 50 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the media-specific table. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated media- specific entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::historyControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table. For example, on an Ethernet network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum utilization. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::historyControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

Each instance of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry will be deleted by the agent if this historyControlEntry is not equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of Ethernet history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,etherHistoryIndex:etherHistorySampleIndex,current,,An historical sample of Ethernet statistics on a particular Ethernet interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same historyControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that had a length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) but were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherHistoryFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.14,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment during this sampling interval. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.15,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUtilization,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the mean physical layer network utilization on this interface during this sampling interval, in hundredths of a percent.

If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.3.1.4,TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB::tokenRingMLHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval.

If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3,RMON-MIB::alarm,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1,RMON-MIB::alarmTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of alarm entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmEntry,,not-accessible,alarmIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic checking for alarm conditions. For example, an instance of the alarmValue object might be named alarmValue.8
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alarm table. Each such entry defines a diagnostic sample at a particular interval for an object on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::alarmInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared with the rising and falling thresholds. When setting this variable, care should be taken in the case of deltaValue sampling - the interval should be set short enough that the sampled variable is very unlikely to increase or decrease by more than 2^31 - 1 during a single sampling interval. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::alarmVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4). This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::alarmSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::alarmValue,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of the statistic during the last sampling period. For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::alarmStartupAlarm,INTEGER,read-create,,current,risingAlarm(1):fallingAlarm(2):risingOrFallingAlarm(3),The alarm that may be sent when this entry is first set to valid. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is less than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was greater than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a falling event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value rises above this threshold and reaches the alarmRisingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a rising threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::alarmOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::alarmStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this alarm entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostControl table. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable on behalf of this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for this instance of the host function. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated hostControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostControlTableSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of hostEntries in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable associated with this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostControlLastDeleteTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the last entry was deleted from the portion of the hostTable associated with this hostControlEntry. If no deletions have occurred, this value shall be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this hostControl entry. If this object is not equal to valid(1), all associated entries in the hostTable, hostTimeTable, and the hostTopNTable shall be deleted by the agent.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that defines the relative ordering of the creation time of hosts captured for a particular hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. It is important to note that the order for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.

This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a download of the table may have missed entries, and where a previous association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::filterPktData,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The data that is to be matched with the input packet. For each packet received, this filter and the accompanying filterPktDataMask and filterPktDataNotMask will be adjusted for the offset. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktDataMask bit equal to one. The following three rules are then applied to every packet: (1) If the packet is too short and does not have data corresponding to part of the filterPktData, the packet will fail this data match. (2) For each relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. (3) If for every relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. Any packets that have not failed any of the three matches above have passed this data match. In particular, a zero length filter will match any packet. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the match algorithm. The offset is applied to filterPktDataMask in the same way it is applied to the filter. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataNotMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktData object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktData object. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatus,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. In particular, a zero length status filter will match any packet's status. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined. For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object, this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the status match process. Only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the status match algorithm. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the size of the filterPktStatus. In addition, if a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusNotMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the status match process. Those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object or a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the longer of the lengths of the filterPktStatus object and the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).

Each such entry defines one channel, a logical data and event stream. It is suggested that before creating a channel, an application should scan all instances of the filterChannelIndex object to make sure that there are no pre-existing filters that would be inadvertently be linked to the channel.

The interface identified by a particular value of this object is the same interface as identified by the same value of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17]. The filters in this group are applied to all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry.

If this object is equal to acceptMatched(1), packets will be accepted to this channel if they are accepted by both the packet data and packet status matches of an associated filter. If this object is equal to acceptFailed(2), packets will be accepted to this channel only if they fail either the packet data match or the packet status match of each of the associated filters. In particular, a channel with no associated filters will match no packets if set to acceptMatched(1) case and will match all packets in the acceptFailed(2) case. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::channelDataControl,INTEGER,read-create,,current,on(1):off(2),This object controls the flow of data through this channel. If this object is on(1), data, status and events flow through this channel. If this object is off(2), data, status and events will not flow through this channel. DEFVAL { off }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOnEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from off to on when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOnEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOffEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from on to off when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOffEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::channelEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to be generated when the associated channelDataControl is on and a packet is matched. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::channelEventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,eventReady(1):eventFired(2):eventAlwaysReady(3),The event status of this channel. If this channel is configured to generate events when packets are matched, a means of controlling the flow of those events is often needed. When this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single event may be generated, after which this object will be set by the probe to eventFired(2). While in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be generated until the object is modified to eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)). The management station can thus easily respond to a notification of an event by re-enabling this object. If the management station wishes to disable this flow control and allow events to be generated at will, this object may be set to eventAlwaysReady(3). Disabling the flow control is discouraged as it can result in high network traffic or other performance problems. DEFVAL { eventReady }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::channelMatches,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times this channel has matched a packet. Note that this object is updated even when channelDataControl is set to off.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::channelDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::channelCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4,RMON2-MIB::filter2Table,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1,RMON2-MIB::filter2Entry,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirDataLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with performs the following operations on every packet: 1) If the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by this object, discard the packet and exit (i.e., discard the packet if it is not of the identified protocol). 2) If the associated filterProtocolDirLocalIndex is non-zero and the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by that object, discard the packet and exit. 3) If the packet matches, perform the regular filter algorithm as if the beginning of this named protocol is the beginning of the packet, potentially applying the filterOffset value to move further into the packet. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with will discard the packet if the packet doesn't match this protocol directory entry. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8,RMON-MIB::capture,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of buffers control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlEntry,,not-accessible,bufferControlIndex,current,,A set of parameters that control the collection of a stream of packets that have matched filters. As an example, an instance of the bufferControlCaptureSliceSize object might be named bufferControlCaptureSliceSize.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the bufferControl table. The value of this index shall never be zero. Each such entry defines one set of packets that is captured and controlled by one or more filters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::bufferControlChannelIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,An index that identifies the channel that is the source of packets for this bufferControl table. The channel identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,spaceAvailable(1):full(2),This object shows whether the buffer has room to accept new packets or if it is full. If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is accepting new packets normally. If the status is full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets to make room for new ones as they arrive. Otherwise, if the status is full(2) and the bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull, then the buffer has stopped collecting packets. When this object is set to full(2) the probe must not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the case of a significant gain in resources such as an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted. In particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old packets to make room for newly arrived packets must not affect the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullAction,INTEGER,read-create,,current,lockWhenFull(1):wrapWhenFull(2),Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status. When in the lockWhenFull(1) state and a packet is added to the buffer that fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCaptureSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet that will be saved in this capture buffer. For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by the probe and this object is set to 500, then only 500 octets of the packet will be stored in the associated capture buffer. If this variable is set to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer, the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain only the first 100 octets of the packet. A prudent manager will take into account possible interoperability or fragmentation problems that may occur if the download slice size is set too large. In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484 octets, although they are encouraged to support larger datagrams whenever feasible. DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset of the first octet of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain bytes starting 100 octets into the packet. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested maximum number of octets to be saved in this captureBuffer, including any implementation-specific overhead. If this variable is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the object has the special value of -1, the probe must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1. DEFVAL { -1 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of octets that can be saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead. If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as possible. When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the request object has the special value of -1, the probe must set this object to -1. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object. When this maximum number of octets is reached and a new packet is to be added to this capture buffer and the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2), enough of the oldest packets associated with this capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so that the new packet can be added. If the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1), the new packet shall be discarded. In either case, the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to full(2). When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the captureBufferTable associated with this bufferControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be deleted by the agent so that the number of octets used remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCapturedPackets,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets currently in this captureBuffer.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTurnOnTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this capture buffer was first turned on.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::bufferControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::bufferControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this buffer Control Entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::captureBufferIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the captureBuffer table associated with a particular bufferControlEntry. This index will start at 1 and increase by one for each new packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex. Should this value reach 2147483647, the next packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex shall cause this value to wrap around to 1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketID,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that describes the order of packets that are received on a particular interface. The packetID of a packet captured on an interface is defined to be greater than the packetID's of all packets captured previously on the same interface. As the captureBufferPacketID object has a maximum positive value of 2^31 - 1, any captureBufferPacketID object shall have the value of the associated packet's packetID mod 2^31.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketData,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The data inside the packet, starting at the beginning of the packet plus any offset specified in the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset, including any link level headers. The length of the data in this object is the minimum of the length of the captured packet minus the offset, the length of the associated bufferControlCaptureSliceSize minus the offset, and the associated bufferControlDownloadSliceSize. If this minimum is less than zero, this object shall have a length of zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketLength,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The actual length (off the wire) of the packet stored in this entry, including FCS octets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketTime,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of milliseconds that had passed since this capture buffer was first turned on when this packet was captured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketStatus,Integer32,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the error status of this packet. The value of this object is defined in the same way as filterPktStatus. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error 3 First packet in this capture buffer after it was detected that some packets were not processed correctly. 4 Packet's order in buffer is only approximate (May only be set for packets sent from the probe) For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined.

In the case of log, an entry is made in the log table for each event. In the case of snmp-trap, an SNMP trap is sent to one or more management stations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::eventCommunity,OCTET,read-create,,current,,If an SNMP trap is to be sent, it will be sent to the SNMP community specified by this octet string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::eventLastTimeSent,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this event entry last generated an event. If this entry has not generated any events, this value will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::eventOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it. If this object contains a string starting with 'monitor' and has associated entries in the log table, all connected management stations should retrieve those log entries, as they may have significance to all management stations connected to this device
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::eventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this event entry. If this object is not equal to valid(1), all associated log entries shall be deleted by the agent.

These indexes are assigned beginning with 1 and increase by one with each new log entry. The association between values of logIndex and logEntries is fixed for the lifetime of each logEntry. The agent may choose to delete the oldest instances of logEntry as required because of lack of memory. It is an implementation-specific matter as to when this deletion may occur.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11,RMON2-MIB::protocolDir,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the protocol directory was last modified, either through insertions or deletions, or through modifications of the protocolDirAddressMapConfig, protocolDirHostConfig, or protocolDirMatrixConfig.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table lists the protocols that this agent has the capability to decode and count. There is one entry in this table for each such protocol. These protocols represent different network-layer, transport-layer, and higher-layer protocols. The agent should boot up with this table preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and wishes to monitor. Implementations are strongly encouraged to support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for the protocol distribution group), even for implementations that don't support the application-layer groups.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDirID:protocolDirParameters,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDirTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the encoding of a length of 8, followed by 8 subids encoding the protocolDirID of 1.2048, followed by a length of 2 and the 2 subids encoding zero-valued parameters. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A unique identifier for a particular protocol. Standard identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e., a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC 2074 for more details. Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect. In other words, it need not populate this table with all possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on the fly when it sees them. Whether it does these things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit, usability) and is up to the designer of the product. If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that the agent doesn't understand, either directly or algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirParameters,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters for the associated protocolDirID. See the associated RMON2 Protocol Identifiers document for a description of the possible parameters. There will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the protocolDirID. Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of parameters for a node is optional). The proper parameter value for each node is included in this string. Note that the inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is not optional. What is optional is that a node may have no parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that node will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The locally arbitrary but unique identifier associated with this protocolDir entry. The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the next agent restart in the event that the protocol directory entry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A textual description of the protocol encapsulation. A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the entire encapsulation (e.g., only the highest layer). This object is intended for human consumption only. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirType,BITS,read-only,,current,extensible(0):addressRecognitionCapable(1),This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol directory entry. The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes whether this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is 'ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built-in support), that child node is not extendable. This is termed 'limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network-level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirAddressMapConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for address mapping for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol. When an entry is created in this table by a management operation as part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting addresses of the extended protocols. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not perform address mapping for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured to perform address mapping for this protocol for all addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol but is configured to not perform address mapping for this protocol for any addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the addressMappingTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirHostConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both the nlHostTable and the alHostTable. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol and is configured to track both tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable. Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirMatrixConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are implemented but don't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for this protocol for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables. Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.9,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable, nlMatrixSDTable, nlMatrixDSTable, alHostTable, alMatrixSDTable, and alMatrixDSTable shall be deleted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics tables. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of protocol statistics is available. Rationale: This table controls collection of very basic statistics for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface. An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by different protocols. A media-specific statistics collection could also be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistControlDroppedFrames.7

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the this protocol distribution. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDistControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the protocolDistStatsTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry is made in this table for every protocol in the protocolDirTable that has been seen in at least one packet. Counters are updated in this table for every protocol type that is encountered when parsing a packet, but no counters are updated for packets with MAC-layer errors. Note that if a protocolDirEntry is deleted, all associated entries in this table are removed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex:protocolDirLocalIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistStatsTable. The index is composed of the protocolDistControlIndex of the associated protocolDistControlEntry, followed by the protocolDirLocalIndex of the associated protocol that this entry represents. In other words, the index identifies the protocol distribution an entry is a part of and the particular protocol that it represents. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistStatsPkts.1.18
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type received without errors. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type received since it was added to the protocolDistStatsTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), except for those octets in packets that contained errors. Note that this doesn't count just those octets in the particular protocol frames but includes the entire packet that contained the protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13,RMON2-MIB::addressMap,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been inserted into the addressMapTable. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been deleted from the addressMapTable (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the addressMapTable. The probe will not create more than this number of entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to control the collection of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. Note that this is not like the typical RMON controlTable and dataTable in which each entry creates its own data table. Each entry in this table enables the discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement of address mappings into the central addressMapTable. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of address mappings is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapControlDroppedFrames.1

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this addressMap control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the addressMapTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. The probe will add entries to this table based on the source MAC and network addresses seen in packets without MAC-level errors. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirAddressMapConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirAddressMapConfig value of supportedOff(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:addressMapNetworkAddress:addressMapSource,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapTable. The protocolDirLocalIndex in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the addressMapNetworkAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapSource.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.11.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapNetworkAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this relation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of ip, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapSource,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The interface or port on which the associated network address was most recently seen. If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this object shall identify the instance of the rptrGroupPortIndex object, defined in [RFC2108], for the desired port. For example, if an entry were to receive data from group #1, port #1, this object would be set to rptrGroupPortIndex.1.1. Note that while the dataSource associated with this entry may only point to index objects, this object may at times point to repeater port objects. This situation occurs when the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally attached repeater and the agent has additional information about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The last source physical address on which the associated network address was seen. If the protocol of the associated network address was encapsulated inside of a network-level or higher protocol, this will be the address of the next-lower protocol with the addressRecognitionCapable bit enabled and will be formatted as specified for that protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last created or the values of the physical address changed. This can be used to help detect duplicate address problems, in which case this object will be updated frequently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14,RMON2-MIB::nlHost,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) host table control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level host tables indexed by network addresses. Both the network- and application-level host tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer host records in memory, it can derive network-layer host records from them.) Entries in the nlHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alHostTable, entries in the alHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of host statistics is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlHostControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hlHostControlTable. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlHostTable, and optionally in the alHostTable, on behalf of this hlHostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the associated host tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for the associated nlHost entries for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlHostTable is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been inserted into the nlHost table. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been deleted from the nlHost table (for any reason).

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the alHostTable is not implemented or is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0.

Each such entry defines a function that discovers conversations on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlMatrixSDTable and the nlMatrixDSTable, and optionally the alMatrixSDTable and alMatrixDSTable, on behalf of this hlMatrixControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of the data for the associated matrix tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlMatrixTables are inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlMatrix entry has been inserted into the nlMatrix tables. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The addition of a conversation into both the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two insertions (even though every addition into one table must be accompanied by an insertion into the other). To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the sum of then nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable sizes can be determined by subtracting hlMatrixControlNlDeletes from hlMatrixControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlMatrix entry has been deleted from the nlMatrix tables (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The deletion of a conversation from both the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two deletions (even though every deletion from one table must be accompanied by a deletion from the other). To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time.

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlMatrixControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the alMatrixTables are not implemented or are inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.2,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixSDTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of traffic matrix entries that collect statistics for conversations between two network-level addresses. This table is indexed first by the source address and then by the destination address to make it convenient to collect all conversations from a particular address. The probe will populate this table for all network layer protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirMatrixConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirMatrixConfig value of supportedOff(2). The probe will add to this table all pairs of addresses seen in all packets with no MAC errors and will increment octet and packet counts in the table for all packets with no MAC errors. Further, this table will only contain entries that have a corresponding entry in the nlMatrixDSTable with the same source address and destination address.

The hlMatrixControlIndex value in the index identifies the hlMatrixControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The protocolDirLocalIndex value in the index identifies the network-layer protocol of the nlMatrixSDSourceAddress and nlMatrixSDDestAddress. An example of the indexing of this table is nlMatrixSDPkts.1.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.4.128.2.6.7. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol.

This object may not be modified if the associated nlMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1). If this value is less than or equal to 2, when the report is prepared, entries are created in the nlMatrixTopNTable associated with this object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated nlMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the nlMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there. When this object is modified by the management station, any associated entries in the nlMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate or nlMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted. It is also an implementation-specific matter as to whether zero-valued entries are available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.9,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this topN report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.

This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries.

The values alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts, alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets, alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityOctets cause collection only from protocols that have no child protocols that are counted. The values alMatrixTopNAllPkts, alMatrixTopNAllOctets, alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityOctets cause collection from all alMatrix entries.

When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated alMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the alMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there.

When the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of alMatrixTopNPktRate or alMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted.

This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the usrHistoryControlTable. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for a specified set of MIB instances available from the managed system.

When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object. The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object should be set before or at the same time as this object to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources required for this usrHistoryControlEntry. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable, the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object.

Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and to set the usrHistoryControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the user history mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more information. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned.

If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be copied directly into the history bucket. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference will be stored in the history bucket. If the associated usrHistoryObjectVariable instance could not be obtained at the previous sample interval, then a delta sample is not possible, and the value of the associated usrHistoryValStatus object for this interval will be valueNotAvailable(1). This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).

This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample that is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalEnd,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the end of the interval over which this sample was measured.

The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed. To obtain the true value for this sampling interval, the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus must be checked, and usrHistoryAbsValue adjusted as necessary. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'. The access control check prescribed in the definition of usrHistoryObjectVariable SHOULD be checked for each sampling interval. If this check determines that access should not be allowed, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'.

If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then 'valueNotAvailable(1)' will be returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is greater than or equal to zero, then 'valuePositive(2)' is returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is less than zero, 'valueNegative(3)' will be returned. The associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue should be multiplied by -1 to obtain the true sample value.

If this counter is increasing, it indicates that the Forwarding Database is regularly becoming full (a condition that has unpleasant performance effects on the subnetwork). If this counter has a significant value but is not presently increasing, it indicates that the problem has been occurring but is not persistent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.2,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dTpAgingTime,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The timeout period in seconds for aging out dynamically-learned forwarding information. 802.1D-1998 recommends a default of 300 seconds.

This table is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least-significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.6.1,P-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dTpPortOverflowEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dTpPort,current,,The most significant bits of statistics counters for a high- capacity interface of a transparent bridge.

The value of zero in this table, as the port number from which frames with a specific destination address are received, is used to specify all ports for which there is no specific entry in this table for that particular destination address. Entries are valid for unicast and for group/broadcast addresses.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.5.1.1,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dStaticEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dStaticAddress:dot1dStaticReceivePort,current,,Filtering information configured into the bridge by (local or network) management specifying the set of ports to which frames received from a specific port and containing a specific destination address are allowed to be forwarded.

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2).

Separate objects are provided for both the most-significant and least-significant bits of statistics counters for ports that are associated with this transparent bridge. The most-significant bit objects are only required on high-capacity interfaces, as defined in the conformance clauses for these objects. This mechanism is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least- significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.

The value of this object should be the name of the interface as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's `console'. This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface as named by the device, then each will have the same value of ifName. Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP queries concerning an interface on some other (proxied) device, then the value of ifName for such an interface is the proxied device's local name for it.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.17,IF-MIB::ifConnectorPresent,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has the value 'true(1)' if the interface sublayer has a physical connector and the value 'false(2)' otherwise.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.6,IF-MIB::ifTestOwner,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The entity which currently has the 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains an entry for each address (broadcast, multicast, or uni-cast) for which the system will receive packets/frames on a particular interface, except as follows: - for an interface operating in promiscuous mode, entries are only required for those addresses for which the system would receive frames were it not operating in promiscuous mode. - for 802.5 functional addresses, only one entry is required, for the address which has the functional address bit ANDed with the bit mask of all functional addresses for which the interface will accept frames. A system is normally able to use any unicast address which corresponds to an entry in this table as a source address.

This object reflects the level of support the DLSw node has for this protocol. (1) means the node has no support for the standard circuit pacing flows; it may use RFC 1434+ methods only, or a proprietary flow control scheme. (2) means the node supports the standard scheme and can vary the window sizes it grants as a data receiver. (3) means the node supports the standard scheme but never varies its receive window size.

Changing the value from active to inactive causes DLSw to take the following actions - (1) it disconnects all circuits through all DLSw partners, (2) it disconnects all transport connections to all DLSw partners, (3) it disconnects all local DLC connections, and (4) it stops processing all DLC connection set-up traffic. Since these are destructive actions, the user should query the circuit and transport connection tables in advance to understand the effect this action will have. Changing the value from inactive to active causes DLSw to come up in its initial state, i.e., transport connections established and ready to bring up circuits.

This value may be compared to dlswTConnOperConnectTime to determine whether values in this row are completely valid for a transport connection created using this row definition.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.6,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigEntryType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,individual(1):global(2):group(3),The object instance signifies the type of entry in the associated conceptual row. The value of `individual' means that the entry applies to a specific partner DLSw node as identified by dlswTConnConfigRemoteTAddr and dlswTConnConfigTDomain. The value of `global' means that the entry applies to all partner DLSw nodes of the TDomain. The value of 'group' means that the entry applies to a specific set of DLSw nodes in the TDomain. Any group definitions are enterprise-specific and are pointed to by dlswTConnConfigGroupDefinition. In the cases of `global' and `group', the value in dlswTConnConfigRemoteTAddr may not have any significance.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.7,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigGroupDefinition,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,For conceptual rows of `individual' and `global' as specified in dlswTConnConfigEntryType, the instance of this object is `0.0'.

The value of activePersistent, activeOnDemand and passive means this DLSw will accept any transport connections, initiated by partner DLSw nodes, which are defined by this conceptual row. The value of activePersistent means this DLSw will also initiate the transport connections of this conceptual row and retry periodically if necessary. The value of activeOnDemand means this DLSw will initiate a transport connection of this conceptual row, if there is a directory cache hits. The value of other is implementation specific. The value of exclude means that the specified node is not allowed to be a partner to this DLSw node. To take a certain conceptual row definition out of service, a value of notInService for dlswTConnConfigRowStatus should be used. DEFVAL { passive }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.9,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigSapList,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The SAP list indicates which SAPs are advertised to the transport connection defined by this conceptual row. Only SAPs with even numbers are represented, in the form of the most significant bit of the first octet representing the SAP 0, the next most significant bit representing the SAP 2, to the least significant bit of the last octet representing the SAP 254. Data link switching is allowed for those SAPs which have one in its corresponding bit, not allowed otherwise. The whole SAP list has to be changed together. Changing the SAP list affects only new circuit establishments and has no effect on established circuits. This list can be used to restrict specific partners from knowing about all the SAPs used by DLSw on all its interfaces (these are represented in dlswIfSapList for each interface). For instance, one may want to run NetBIOS with some partners but not others. If a node supports sending run-time capabilities exchange messages, changes to this object should cause that action. When to start the run-time capabilities exchange is implementation-specific. The DEFVAL below indicates support for SAPs 0, 4, 8, and C. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.10,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigAdvertiseMacNB,INTEGER,read-create,,current,true(1):false(2),The value of true indicates that any defined local MAC addresses and NetBIOS names will be advertised to a partner node via initial and (if supported) run-time capabilities exchange messages. The DLSw node should send the appropriate exclusivity control vector to accompany each list it sends, or to represent that the node is explicitly configured to have a null list. The value of false indicates that the DLSw node should not send a MAC address list or NetBIOS name list, and should also not send their corresponding exclusivity control vectors. DEFVAL { true }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.11,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigInitCirRecvWndw,INTEGER,read-create,,current,,The initial circuit receive pacing window size, in the unit of SSP messages, to be used for future transport connections activated using this table row. The managed node sends this value as its initial receive pacing window in its initial capabilities exchange message. Changing this value does not affect the initial circuit receive pacing window size of currently active transport connections. If the standard window pacing scheme is not supported, the value is zero. A larger receive window value may be appropriate for partners that are reachable only via physical paths that have longer network delays. DEFVAL { 1 }

It is optional but desirable for the agent to keep an entry for some period of time after the transport connection is disconnected. This allows the manager to capture additional useful information about the connection, in particular, statistical information and the cause of the disconnection.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.1,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperTDomain,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The object identifier indicates the transport domain of this transport connection.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.2,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperLocalTAddr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The local transport address for this transport connection. This value could be different from dlswTConnConfigLocalAddr, if the value of the latter were changed after this transport connection was established.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.3,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperRemoteTAddr,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The remote transport address of this transport connection.

The transport connection enters `connecting' state when DLSw makes a connection request to the transport layer. Once initial Capabilities Exchange is sent, the transport connection enters enters `initCapExchange' state. When partner capabilities have been determined and the transport connection is ready for sending CanUReach (CUR) messages, it moves to the `connected' state. When DLSw is in the process of bringing down the connection, it is in the `disconnecting' state. When the transport layer indicates one of its connections is disconnected, the transport connection moves to the `disconnected' state. Whereas all of the values will be returned in response to a management protocol retrieval operation, only two values may be specified in a management protocol set operation: `quiescing' and `disconnecting'. Changing the value to `quiescing' prevents new circuits from being established, and will cause a transport disconnect when the last circuit on the connection goes away. Changing the value to `disconnecting' will force off all circuits immediately and bring the connection to `disconnected' state.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.7,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperConfigIndex,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,The value of dlswTConnConfigIndex of the dlswTConnConfigEntry that governs the configuration information used by this dlswTConnOperEntry. The manager can therefore normally examine both configured and operational information for this transport connection. This value is zero if the corresponding dlswTConnConfigEntry was deleted after the creation of this dlswTConnOperEntry. If some fields in the former were changed but the conceptual row was not deleted, some configuration information may not be valid for this operational transport connection. The manager can compare dlswTConnOperConnectTime and dlswTConnConfigLastModifyTime to determine if this condition exists.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.5.2,DLSW-MIB::dlswCircuitTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table is the circuit representation in the DLSw entity. Virtual data links are used to represent any internal end stations. There is a conceptual row associated with each data link. Thus, for circuits without an intervening transport connection, there are two conceptual rows for each circuit. The table consists of the circuits being established, established, and as an implementation option, circuits that have been disconnected. For circuits carried over transport connections, an entry is created after the CUR_cs was sent or received. For circuits between two locally attached devices, or internal virtual MAC addresses, an entry is created when the equivalent of CUR_cs sent/received status is reached. End station 1 (S1) and End station 2 (S2) are used to represent the two end stations of the circuit. S1 is always an end station which is locally attached. S2 may be locally attached or remote. If it is locally attached, the circuit will be represented by two rows indexed by (A, B) and (B, A) where A & B are the relevant MACs/SAPs. The table may be used to store the causes of disconnection of circuits. It is recommended that the oldest disconnected circuit entry be removed from this table when the memory space of disconnected circuits is needed.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entityPhysical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per physical entity. There is always at least one row for an 'overall' physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular physical entity. Each entry provides objects (entPhysicalDescr, entPhysicalVendorType, and entPhysicalClass) to help an NMS identify and characterize the entry and objects (entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalParentRelPos) to help an NMS relate the particular entry to other entries in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index for this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of physical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the physical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version or model of the physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalVendorType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the vendor-specific hardware type of the physical entity. Note that this is different from the definition of MIB-II's sysObjectID. An agent should set this object to an enterprise-specific registration identifier value indicating the specific equipment type in detail. The associated instance of entPhysicalClass is used to indicate the general type of hardware device. If no vendor-specific registration identifier exists for this physical entity, or the value is unknown by this agent, then the value { 0 0 } is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainedIn,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the physical entity that 'contains' this physical entity. A value of zero indicates this physical entity is not contained in any other physical entity. Note that the set of 'containment' relationships define a strict hierarchy; that is, recursion is not allowed. In the event that a physical entity is contained by more than one physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this object should identify the containing entity with the lowest value of entPhysicalIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalClass,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):unknown(2):chassis(3):backplane(4):container(5):powerSupply(6):fan(7):sensor(8):module(9):port(10):stack(11):cpu(12):energyObject(13):battery(14):storageDrive(15),An indication of the general hardware type of the physical entity. An agent should set this object to the standard enumeration value that most accurately indicates the general class of the physical entity, or the primary class if there is more than one entity. If no appropriate standard registration identifier exists for this physical entity, then the value 'other(1)' is returned. If the value is unknown by this agent, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalParentRelPos,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An indication of the relative position of this 'child' component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The textual name of the physical entity. The value of this object should be the name of the component as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's 'console'. This might be a text name (e.g., 'console') or a simple component number (e.g., port or module number, such as '1'), depending on the physical component naming syntax of the device. If there is no local name, or if this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string. Note that the value of entPhysicalName for two physical entities will be the same in the event that the console interface does not distinguish between them, e.g., slot-1 and the card in slot-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalHardwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific hardware revision string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the hardware revision identifier actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific hardware revision string is associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.9,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalFirmwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific firmware revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific firmware programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.10,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSoftwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific software revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific software programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSerialNum,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The vendor-specific serial number string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the serial number string actually printed on the component itself (if present). On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this information is available to the agent. If a serial number is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be set to a zero-length string instead. Note that implementations that can correctly identify the serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum object. Agents that cannot provide non-volatile storage for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to implement write access for this object. Not every physical component will have a serial number, or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique serial numbers. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalSerialNum and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalSerialNum instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.12,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The name of the manufacturer of this physical component. The preferred value is the manufacturer name string actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that comparisons between instances of the entPhysicalModelName, entPhysicalFirmwareRev, entPhysicalSoftwareRev, and the entPhysicalSerialNum objects are only meaningful amongst entPhysicalEntries with the same value of entPhysicalMfgName. If the manufacturer name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.13,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalModelName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific model name identifier string associated with this physical component. The preferred value is the customer-visible part number, which may be printed on the component itself. If the model name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.14,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the physical entity, as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the physical entity. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAlias associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. However, the agent may set the value to a locally unique default value, instead of a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAlias and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAlias instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.15,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAssetID,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is a user-assigned asset tracking identifier (as specified by a network manager) for the physical entity and provides non-volatile storage of this information. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAssetID associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. Not every physical component will have an asset tracking identifier or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique asset tracking identifier. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may instead return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAssetID and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAssetID instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value. If no asset tracking information is associated with the physical component, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.16,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIsFRU,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object indicates whether or not this physical entity is considered a 'field replaceable unit' by the vendor. If this object contains the value 'true(1)', then this entPhysicalEntry identifies a field replaceable unit. For all entPhysicalEntries that represent components permanently contained within a field replaceable unit, the value 'false(2)' should be returned for this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.17,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgDate,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the date of manufacturing of the managed entity. If the manufacturing date is unknown or not supported, the object is not instantiated. The special value '0000000000000000'H may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.18,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUris,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains URIs; therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 3986, Section 3. Multiple URIs may be present and are separated by white space characters. Leading and trailing white space characters are ignored. If no URI identification information is known about the physical entity, the object is not instantiated. A zero-length octet string may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.19,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUUID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains a Universally Unique Identifier, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 4122, Section 4.1. A zero-length octet string is returned if no UUID information is known.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityLogical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per logical entity. For agents that implement more than one naming scope, at least one entry must exist. Agents that instantiate all MIB objects within a single naming scope are not required to implement this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical entity. Entities may be managed by this agent or other SNMP agents (possibly) in the same chassis.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the logical entity. The value should be a small positive integer; index values for different logical entities are not necessarily contiguous.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the logical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the logical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version of the logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the type of logical entity. This will typically be the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of the node in the SMI's naming hierarchy that represents the major MIB module, or the majority of the MIB modules, supported by the logical entity. For example: a logical entity of a regular host/router -> mib-2 a logical entity of a 802.1d bridge -> dot1dBridge a logical entity of a 802.3 repeater -> snmpDot3RptrMgmt If an appropriate node in the SMI's naming hierarchy cannot be identified, the value 'mib-2' should be used.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalCommunity,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,An SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string, which can be used to access detailed management information for this logical entity. The agent should allow read access with this community string (to an appropriate subset of all managed objects) and may also return a community string based on the privileges of the request used to read this object. Note that an agent may return a community string with read-only privileges, even if this object is accessed with a read-write community string. However, the agent must take care not to return a community string that allows more privileges than the community string used to access this object. A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default' naming scope. This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common. For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'. Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default' naming scope. For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the value of this object is the empty string. This object may also contain an empty string if a community string has not yet been assigned by the agent or if no community string with suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP request. Note that this object is deprecated. Agents that implement SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context associated with each logical entity. SNMPv3 agents may return a zero-length string for this object or may continue to return a community string (e.g., tri-lingual agent support).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The transport service address by which the logical entity receives network management traffic, formatted according to the corresponding value of entLogicalTDomain. For snmpUDPDomain, a TAddress is 6 octets long: the initial 4 octets contain the IP-address in network-byte order, and the last 2 contain the UDP port in network-byte order. Consult RFC 3417 for further information on snmpUDPDomain.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTDomain,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,Indicates the kind of transport service by which the logical entity receives network management traffic. Possible values for this object are presently found in RFC 3417.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextEngineID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The authoritative contextEngineID that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextName object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The contextName that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextEngineID object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entityMapping,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows of logical entity to physical equipment associations. For each logical entity known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the physical resources, which are used to realize that logical entity. An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant information is returned. For example, in a system that contains a single power supply, mappings between logical entities and the power supply are not useful and should not be included. Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry. For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information). On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate. Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not necessary.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex:entLPPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical-entity-to-physical- equipment association. Note that the nature of the association is not specifically identified in this entry. It is expected that sufficient information exists in the MIB modules used to manage a particular logical entity to infer how physical component information is utilized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPPhysicalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies the index value of a particular entPhysicalEntry associated with the indicated entLogicalEntity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows, representing mappings of logical entities and physical components to external MIB identifiers. Each physical port in the system may be associated with a mapping to an external identifier, which itself is associated with a particular logical entity's naming scope. A 'wildcard' mechanism is provided to indicate that an identifier is associated with more than one logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,current,,Information about a particular binding between a logical entity/physical component pair and an external identifier. Each logical entity/physical component pair may be associated with one alias mapping. The logical entity index may also be used as a 'wildcard' (refer to the entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero objectclause for details.) Note that only entPhysicalIndex values that represent physical ports (i.e., associated entPhysicalClass value is 'port(10)') are permitted to exist in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object identifies the logical entity that defines the naming scope for the associated instance of the entAliasMappingIdentifier object. If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex. If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between the physical component and the alias identifier for this entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified logical entities. That is, a value of zero (the default mapping) identifies any logical entity that does not have an explicit entry in this table for a particular entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair. For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g., physical component 33) is identified by the same value of ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance might exist: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5 In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping entries may exist, e.g.: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12 Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero index values have precedence over zero-indexed entries. In this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10 associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingIdentifier,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and entLogicalIndex pair. Because only physical ports are modeled in this table, only entries that represent interfaces or ports are allowed. If an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port, then this object should identify the associated ifEntry. For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the 'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead. For example, suppose a physical port was represented by entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge. Then there might be two related instances of entAliasMappingIdentifier: entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2 entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17 It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required. Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort' and are thus not represented in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table that exposes the container/'containee' relationships between physical entities. This table provides all the information found by constructing the virtual containment tree for a given entPhysicalTable, but in a more direct format. In the event a physical entity is contained by more than one other physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this table should include these additional mappings, which cannot be represented in the entPhysicalTable virtual containment tree.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entPhysicalChildIndex,current,,A single container/'containee' relationship.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalChildIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the contained physical entity.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.4.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLastChangeTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time a conceptual row is created, modified, or deleted in any of these tables: - entPhysicalTable - entLogicalTable - entLPMappingTable - entAliasMappingTable - entPhysicalContainsTable 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTraps,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTrapPrefix,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0.1,ENTITY-MIB::entConfigChange,,,,,,An entConfigChange notification is generated when the value of entLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls. An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange 'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds is the suggested default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the throttling period, then notification-events for these changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current throttling period expires. At the end of a throttling period, one notification-event should be generated if any configuration changes occurred since the start of the throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period is started right away. An NMS should periodically check the value of entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.

The RowStatus of a currently active row in the  vrrpOperTable is constrained by the operational state of  the corresponding virtual router.  When `vrrpOperRowStatus' is set to active(1), no other  objects in the conceptual row, with the exception of  `vrrpOperAdminState', can be modified. Prior to setting  the `vrrpOperRowStatus' object from `active' to a  different value, the `vrrpOperAdminState' object must be  set to `down' and the `vrrpOperState' object be  transitioned to `initialize'.   To create a row in this table, a manager sets this object  to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5). Until  instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately  configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the  `vrrpOperRowStatus' column will be read as notReady(3).   In particular, a newly created row cannot be made  active(1) until (minimally) the corresponding instance of  `vrrpOperVrId' has been set and there is at least one  active row in the `vrrpAssoIpAddrTable' defining an  associated IP address for the virtual router.

Higher values  imply higher priority.   A priority of '0', although not settable, is sent by  the master router to indicate that this router has  ceased to participate in VRRP and a backup virtual  router should transition to become a new master.   A priority of 255 is used for the router that owns the  associated IP address(es) for VRRP over IPv4 and hence  not settable.   A 'badValue(3)' should be returned when a user tries to  set 0 or 255 for this object.  DEFVAL { 100 }

The first index element, pingCtlOwnerIndex, is of type SnmpAdminString, a textual convention that allows for use of the SNMPv3 View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 3415, VACM) and that allows a management application to identify its entries. The second index, pingCtlTestName (also an SnmpAdminString), enables the same management application to have multiple outstanding requests.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.1,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlOwnerIndex,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which multiple users may need to create or modify entries independently, the initial index is used as an 'owner index'. Such an initial index has a syntax of SnmpAdminString and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName or groupName defined in VACM, in accordance with a security policy. When used in conjunction with such a security policy, all entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or group) will have the same value for this initial index. For a given user's entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers (except for the 'column' subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index. To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask 'wildcarding' the column subidentifier. More elaborate configurations are possible.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.2,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlTestName,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The name of the ping test. This is locally unique, within the scope of a pingCtlOwnerIndex.

A single ping test consists of a series of ping probes. The number of probes is determined by the value of the corresponding pingCtlProbeCount object. After a single test is completed the number of seconds as defined by the value of pingCtlFrequency MUST elapse before the next ping test is started. A value of 0 for this object implies that the test as defined by the corresponding entry will not be repeated. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.11,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlMaxRows,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of corresponding entries allowed in the pingProbeHistoryTable. An implementation of this MIB will remove the oldest corresponding entry in the pingProbeHistoryTable to allow the addition of an new entry once the number of corresponding rows in the pingProbeHistoryTable reaches this value. Old entries are not removed when a new test is started. Entries are added to the pingProbeHistoryTable until pingCtlMaxRows is reached before entries begin to be removed.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.21,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlByPassRouteTable,INTEGER,read-create,,current,true(1):false(2),The purpose of this object is to enable optional bypassing the route table. If enabled, the remote host will bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network. If the host is not on a directly attached network, an error is returned. This option can be used to perform the ping operation to a local host through an interface that has no route defined (e.g., after the interface was dropped by the routing daemon at the host).

The octet to be set in the IP header contains the Differentiated Services (DS) Field in the six most significant bits. This option can be used to determine what effect an explicit DS Field setting has on a ping response. Not all values are legal or meaningful. A value of 0 means that the function represented by this option is not supported. DS Field usage is often not supported by IP implementations, and not all values are supported. Refer to RFC 2474 and RFC 3260 for guidance on usage of this field. DEFVAL { 0 }

Deletion of an entry in this table results in the deletion of all corresponding (same pingCtlOwnerIndex and pingCtlTestName index values) pingResultsTable and pingProbeHistoryTable entries. A value MUST be specified for pingCtlTargetAddress prior to acceptance of a transition to active(1) state. When a value for pingCtlTargetAddress is set, the value of object pingCtlRowStatus changes from notReady(3) to notInService(2). Activation of a remote ping operation is controlled via pingCtlAdminStatus, not by changing this object's value to active(1). Transitions in and out of active(1) state are not allowed while an entry's pingResultsOperStatus is active(1), with the exception that deletion of an entry in this table by setting its RowStatus object to destroy(6) will stop an active ping operation. The operational state of a ping operation can be determined by examination of its pingResultsOperStatus object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.3,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingResultsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Defines the Ping Results Table for providing the capability of performing ping operations at a remote host. The results of these operations are stored in the pingResultsTable and the pingProbeHistoryTable. An entry is added to the pingResultsTable when an pingCtlEntry is started by successful transition of its pingCtlAdminStatus object to enabled(1). If the object pingCtlAdminStatus already has the value enabled(1), and if the corresponding pingResultsOperStatus object has the value completed(3), then successfully writing enabled(1) to object pingCtlAdminStatus re-initializes the already existing entry in the pingResultsTable. The values of objects in the re-initialized entry are the same as the values of objects in a new entry would be. An entry is removed from the pingResultsTable when its corresponding pingCtlEntry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.3.1,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingResultsEntry,,not-accessible,pingCtlOwnerIndex:pingCtlTestName,current,,Defines an entry in the pingResultsTable.

When it reaches the maximum value,an extremely unlikely event, the agent wraps the value back to 1 and may flush existing entries. From bit16 to bit31 (two bytes) is the physical index the same as the entPhysicalIndex specified in ENTITY-MIB(RFC2737). If ENTITY-MIB is not supported,the value for this object is the unit ID for XRN devices ,0 for non-XRN device which has only one main board,the board number for non-XRN device which have several main boards. Any index beyond the above range will not be supported. If a file is added in, its hh3cSysImageIndex will be the maximum image index plus one.

For devices which support dual image: If the value is 'main(1)',the image will be the first image in the next reloading procedure. If the value is 'backup(2)', the image will be used if the main image fails. If the value is 'secure(4)', the image will be used if the main image and backup image both fail. If the value is 'none(3)',the image will not be used in the next reloading procedure. At the same time,you also can specify the main image by hh3cSysReloadImage in hh3cSysReloadScheduleTable. If the image is different from previous main image, the previous main image will not be main image again. And the image table will update with this variation. Vice versa, if you have defined the reload schedule, and then you define a new main image through hh3cSysImageType when you are waiting the reload schedule to be executed, the real main image will be the latest one. It is strongly suggested to define the main image here, not by hh3cSysReloadImage in hh3cSysReloadScheduleTable. There are some rules for setting the value of hh3cSysImageType: a)When a new image file is defined as 'main' or 'backup' file,the hh3cSysImageType of old 'main' or 'backup' file will automatically be 'none'. b)It is forbidden to set 'none' attribute manually. c)It is forbidden to set 'secure' attribute manually. d)If 'main' image is set to 'backup', the file keeps 'main'. And vice versa. At this time, the file has 'main-backup' property. e)If the secure image is set to 'main' or 'backup', the file has 'main-secure' or 'backup-secure'property. f)If the secure image is set to 'main' and 'backup', the file has the 'main-backup-secure' property. g)If the none image is set to 'main' or 'backup', the file has the 'main' or 'backup' property. The following table describes whether it is ok to set to another state directly from original state. +--------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+ | set to | set to | set to | set to | | | | | | original | 'main' | 'backup' | 'none' | 'secure' | state | | | | | --------------+--------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+ | | | | | main | --- | yes | no | no | | | | | | | | | | | --------------+--------------+-----------+-------------|-------------+ | | | | | backup | yes | --- | no | no | | | | | | --------------+--------------+-----------+-------------|-------------+ | | | | | | | | | | none | yes | yes | --- | no | | | | | | --------------+--------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+ | | | | | secure | yes | yes | no | --- | | | | | | | | | | |

See hh3cSecureNeedToKnowMode and hh3cSecureIntrusionAction to configure Need To Know and Intrusion Action on each port. (When in a learning mode, hh3cSecureNumberAddresses determines the maximum number of addresses that can be learned on the port. This is set by the user.) noRestrictions(1) All of the security features are disabled. continuousLearning(2) Addresses are learned continually. If more addresses are learned than are permitted on the port, then one of the older entries will be aged out. Need To Know and Intrusion Action depends on hh3cSecureNeedToKnowMode and hh3cSecureIntrusionAction respectively. autoLearn(3) All addresses for this port are deleted, and then addresses are learned up to the number permitted. hh3cSecurePortMode is then set to secure. Need To Know and Intrusion Action depends on hh3cSecureNeedToKnowMode and hh3cSecureIntrusionAction respectively. secure(4) Learning is disabled. Need To Know and Intrusion Action depends on hh3cSecureNeedToKnowMode and hh3cSecureIntrusionAction respectively. userLogin(5) Access to the port is denied until the port client is authorised (by 802.1X or other authentication mechanism). Once authorised, traffic will be accepted from any MAC address. The Need To Know and Intrusion Action are ignored. userLoginSecure(6) Access to the port is denied until the port client is authorised (by 802.1X or other authentication mechanism). When the client is authorised, the MAC address is added to the Secure Address Table. The hh3cSecureMaximumAddresses is set to one automatically when this mode is entered. Any existing MAC addresses in the Secure Address Table are deleted. Need To Know and Intrusion Action depends on hh3cSecureNeedToKnowMode and hh3cSecureIntrusionAction respectively. Learning is disabled. userLoginWithOUI(7) This mode is similar to the userLoginSecure mode except that a second MAC address may be placed in the Secure Address Table. This second address is authorised based on the MAC address OUI value. If a new device with an authorised OUI value is discovered, the previous entry is deleted. Traffic from the OUI authorised device will be accepted even if the user has not been authenticated. Need To Know and Intrusion Action depends on hh3cSecureNeedToKnowMode and hh3cSecureIntrusionAction respectively. macAddressWithRadius(8) This selects the RADIUS Authenticated Login using MAC-address (RALM) security mode on the port. This feature controls network access of a host based on authenticating its MAC address. Once authorised, the host is allowed access to the network. If unauthorised, the port can be configured to deny access to this MAC address or to allow some access depending upon the port VLAN and QoS configuration. Where access is allowed, the MAC address is added to the Secure Address Table. macAddressOrUserLoginSecure(9) This selects both the macAddressWithRadius and userLoginSecure modes together such that either or both are allowed to authorised access. Where both authorised access, userLoginSecure takes precedence. macAddressElseUserLoginSecure(10) This selects both the macAddressWithRadius and userLoginSecure modes together such that the MAC address is first authenticated and only if this fails does the userLoginSecure then attempt user authentication. userLoginSecureExt(11) Access to the port

Sub interfaces are logical virtual interfaces configured on a main interface. The main interface can be either a physical interface (such as a Layer 3 Ethernet interface) or a logical interface (such as an MFR interface). The subinterfaces on a main interface share the physical layer parameters of the main interface but can have link layer and network layer parameters of their own. Disabling or enabling a subinterface does not affect the main interface, but the main interface status change affects the subinterfaces. The subinterfaces cannot operate normally unless the main interface is connected. A single physical interface containing multiple subinterfaces enables you to network in a more flexible way. You can create subinterfaces for the following physical interfaces: Ethernet interface. An Ethernet subinterface associated with no VLAN supports only IPX, while an Ethernet subinterface associated with a VLAN supports both IP and IPX. WAN interfaces with their data link layer protocols being frame relay, whose subinterfaces support IP and IPX. WAN interfaces with their data link layer protocols being X.25, whose subinterfaces support IP and IPX. ATM interface, whose subinterfaces support only IP.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cEfmOamMIB,,,,,,The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile task force (IEEE 802.3ah). The functionality presented here is based on IEEE 802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004. In particular, this MIB focused on the changes to Clause 30 of the draft that are not specific to any physical layer. These changes are primarily reflected in the new OAM features developed under this project, that can be applied to any Ethernet like interface. The OAM features are described in Clause 57 of [802.3ah]. This MIB is excerpted from the draft files directly,only changed the object name,added the hh3c as prefix. The following reference is used throughout this MIB module: [802.3ah] refers to: IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004: 'Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan are networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks', October 2004.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.1,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Primary controls and status for the OAM capabilities of an Ethernet like interface. There will be one row in this table for each Ethernet like interface in the system that supports the Ethernet OAM functions defined in [802.3ah].
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.1.1,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table, containing information on the Ethernet OAM function for a single Ethernet like interface.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.1.1.1,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamAdminState,INTEGER,read-write,,current,disabled(1):enabled(2),This object is used to provision the default administrative OAM mode for this interface. This object represents the desired state of OAM for this interface. The hh3cDot3OamAdminState always starts in the disabled(1) state until an explicity management action or configuration information retained by the system causes a transition to the enabled(2) state. Note that the value of this object is ignored when the interface is not operating in full-duplex mode. OAM is not supported on half-duplex links. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.1.1.2,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,disabled(1):linkfault(2):passiveWait(3):activeSendLocal(4):sendLocalAndRemote(5):sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6):oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7):oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8):operational(9),At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link. The progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM sublayer. This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this interface via the hh3cDot3OamAdminState. If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in passive mode (hh3cDot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM capable. The activeSendLocal(4) is used by active mode devices (hh3cDot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has not yet made that determination. The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or rejected the configuration of the peer. The local device can, for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is unacceptable and decline OAM peering. If the local OAM entity rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7). If the OAM peering is allowed by the local device, the state moves to sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering or has just not indicated any decision yet. Whether a peering decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.10). If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected the peering or has just not yet decided. This is indicated via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11). When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5]. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.1.1.3,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,active(1):passive(2),This object configures the mode of OAM operation for this Ethernet like interface. OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in 'active' mode or 'passive' mode. These two modes differ in that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM actions with it. As an example, an active OAM entity can put the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM entity cannot. Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the hh3cDot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9).

OAM entities exchange maximum OAMPDU sizes and negotiate to use the smaller of the two maximum OAMPDU sizes between the peers. This value is determined by the local implementation. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.1.1.5,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamConfigRevision,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The configuration revision of the OAM entity as reflected in the latest OAMPDU sent by the OAM entity. The config revision is used by OAM entities to indicate configuration changes have occured which might require the peer OAM entity to re-evaluate whether the peering is allowed. See local_satisfied in [802.3ah, 57.3.1.2]. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.1.1.6,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamFunctionsSupported,BITS,read-only,,current,unidirectionalSupport(0):loopbackSupport(1):eventSupport(2):variableSupport(3),The OAM functions supported on this Ethernet like interface. OAM consists of separate functional sets beyond the basic discovery process which is always required. These functional groups can be supported independently by any implementation. These values are communicated to the peer via the local configuration field of Information OAMPDUs. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.2,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamPeerTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Information about the OAM peer for a particular Ethernet like interface. OAM entities communicate with a single OAM peer entity on full-duplex Ethernet links on which OAM is enabled and operating properly. In certain states, the OAM peer information is not available. Whether peer information is available is communicated via the hh3cDot3OamPeerStatus object. When this object is inactive, all other information in the row is to be considered invalid. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.2.1,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamPeerEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table, containing information on the peer OAM entity for a single Ethernet like interface. Note that there is at most one OAM peer for each Ethernet like interface. There is exactly one row in this table for each Ethernet like interface supporting OAM.

When active(1), the information is valid and represents the current peer of the OAM entity. When inactive(2), the information in this row is invalid. A value of inactive(2) is returned if the hh3cDot3OamOperStatus is disabled, passiveWait, or activeSendLocal. For all other values of hh3cDot3OamOperStatus, a value of active(1) is returned. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.2.1.2,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamPeerMacAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The MAC address of the peer OAM entity. The MAC address is derived from the most recently received OAMPDU. This value is initialized to all zeros (0x000000000000). This value is invalid if the hh3cDot3OamPeerStatus is inactive. An OAMPDU is indicated by a valid frame with (1) destination MAC address equal to that of the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), (2) a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, (3) and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for OAM.

The OUI can be used to identify the vendor of the remote OAM entity. This value is initialized to all zeros (0x000000). This value is considered invalid if the hh3cDot3OamPeerStatus is inactive. An Information OAMPDU is indicated by a valid frame with (1) destination MAC address equal to that of the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), (2) a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, (3) a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for OAM, (4) a OAM code that equals the code reserved for Information OAMPDUs.

The vendor information field is within the Local Information TLV, and can be used to determine additional information about the peer entity. The format of the vendor information is unspecified within the 32-bit field. This value is intialized to all zeros (0x00000000). This value is invalid if the hh3cDot3OamPeerStatus is inactive. An Information OAMPDU is indicated by a valid frame with (1) destination MAC address equal to that of the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), (2) a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, (3) a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for OAM, and (4) a OAM code that equals the code reserved for Information OAMPDUs.

The mode of the peer can be determined from the Configuration field in the Local Information TLV of the last Information OAMPDU received from the peer. This value is initialized to unknown(3), and is not valid if the hh3cDot3OamPeerStatus is inactive.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.2.1.6,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamPeerMaxOamPduSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum size of OAMPDU supported by the peer as reflected in the latest Information OAMPDU received with a Local Information TLV. Ethernet OAM on this interface must not use OAMPDUs that exceed this size. The maximum OAMPDU size can be determined from the PDU Configuration field of the Local Information TLV of the last Information OAMPDU received from the peer. This value is initialized to 64, and is invalid if the hh3cDot3OamPeerStatus is inactive. An Information OAMPDU is indicated by a valid frame with (1) destination MAC address equal to that of the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), (2) a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, (3) a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for OAM, and (4) a OAM code that equals the code reserved for Information OAMPDUs.

This attribute is changed by the peer whenever it has a local configuration change for Ethernet OAM this interface. This value is initialized to all zeros (0x00000000), and is invalid if the hh3cDot3OamPeerStatus is inactive. The configuration revision can be determined from the Revision field of the Local Information TLV of the most recently received Information OAMPDU with a Local Information TLV. An Information OAMPDU is indicated by a valid frame with (1) destination MAC address equal to that of the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), (2) a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, (3) a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for OAM, and (4) a OAM code that equals the code reserved for Information OAMPDUs.

OAM consists of separate functionality sets above the basic discovery process. This value indicates the capabilities of the peer OAM entity with respect to these functions. This value is initialized so all bits are clear, and is invalid if the hh3cDot3OamPeerStatus is inactive. The capbilities of the OAM peer can be determined from the configuration field of the Local Information TLV of the most recently received Information OAMPDU with a Local Information TLV. An Information OAMPDU is indicated by a valid frame with (1) destination MAC address equal to that of the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), (2) a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, (3) a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for OAM, and (4) a OAM code that equals the code reserved for Information OAMPDUs. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.3,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamLoopbackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains methods to control the loopback state of the local link as well as indicating the status of the loopback function. Loopback can be used to place the remote OAM entity in a state where every received frame (except OAMPDUs) are echoed back over the same interface on which they were received. In this state, at the remote entity, 'normal' traffic is disabled as only the looped back frames are transmitted on the interface. Loopback is thus an intrusive operation that prohibits normal data flow and should be used accordingly. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.3.1,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamLoopbackEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table, containing information on the loopback status for a single Ethernet like interface. There is an entry in this table for every Ethernet like interface on which supports OAM and loopback function within OAM (as indicated in hh3cDot3OamFunctionsSupported). 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.3.1.1,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamLoopbackCommand,INTEGER,read-write,,current,noLoopback(1):startRemoteLoopback(2):stopRemoteLoopback(3),This attribute initiates or terminates remote loopback with an OAM peer. Writing startRemoteLoopback(2) to this attribute cause the local OAM client to send a loopback OAMPDU to the OAM peer with the loopback enable flags set. Writing stopRemoteLoopback(3) to this attribute will cause the local OAM client to send a loopback OAMPDU to the OAM peer with the loopback enable flags cleared. Writing noLoopback to this attribute has no effect. Writes to this attribute are ignored unless the OAM status of this interface is 'operational' (hh3cDot3OamOperStatus). The attribute always returns noLoopback on a read. To determine the loopback status, use the attribute hh3cDot3OamLoopbackStatus. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.42.3.1.3.1.2,HH3C-EFM-COMMON-MIB::hh3cDot3OamLoopbackStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,noLoopback(1):initiatingLoopback(2):remoteLoopback(3):terminatingLoopback(4):localLoopback(5):unknown(6),The loopback status of the OAM entity. This status is determined by a combination of the local parser and multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states, as well as by the actions of the local OAM client. When operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the status reads noLoopback(1). If the OAM client has sent an Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'. In this case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any acknowledgement that the remote OAM entity has received its loopback command request. If the local OAM client knows that the remote OAM entity is in loopback mode (via the remote state information as described in [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1, 30.3.6.1.15]), the status is remoteLoopback(3). If the local OAM client is in the process of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3, 30.3.6.1.14], with its local multiplexer and parser states in DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4). If the remote OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as indicated by its local parser state, the status is localLoopback(5). The unknown(6) status indicates the parser and multiplexer combination is unexpected. This status may be returned if the OAM loopback is in a transition state but should not persist. The values of this attribute correspond to the following values of the local and remote parser and multiplexer states. value LclPrsr LclMux RmtPrsr RmtMux noLoopback FWD FWD FWD FWD initLoopback DISCARD DISCARD FWD FWD rmtLoopback DISCARD FWD LPBK DISCARD tmtngLoopback DISCARD DISCARD LPBK DISCARD lclLoopback LPBK DISCARD DISCARD FWD unknown *** any other combination ***

When the value is ignore(1), received loopback commands are ignored. When the value is process(2), OAM loopback commands are processed. The default value is to ignore loopback commands (ignore(1)). The attribute has no meaning if the local OAM entity does not support the loopback function (as defined in hh3cDot3OamFunctionsSupported).

An Information OAMPDU is indicated by a valid frame with (1) destination MAC address equal to that of the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), (2) a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, (3) a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for OAM, and (4) an OAMPDU code equals the OAM Information code. Discontinuities of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of the ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment could. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.

The primary mode which the BFD session runs in is known as  Asynchronous mode. In this mode, the systems periodically  send BFD Control packets to one another, and if a number of those packets in a row are not received by the other system,  the session is declared to be down.  The second mode is known as Demand mode. In this mode, it is  assumed that each system has an independent way of verifying  that it has connectivity to the other system. Once a BFD  session is established, the systems stop sending BFD Control  packets, except when either system feels the need to verify  connectivity explicitly, in which case a short sequence of BFD  Control packets is sent, and then the protocol quiesces.  An adjunct to both modes is the Echo function. When the Echo function is active, a stream of BFD Echo packets is transmitted  in such a way as to have the other system loop them back through  its forwarding path. If a number of packets of the echoed data  stream are not received, the session is declared to be down.  The Echo function may be used with either Asynchronous or  Demand modes.  The 'asynchModeWOEchoFun' indicates this BFD session operates in  the Asynchronous mode, and doesn't support the Echo Function.  The 'demandModeWOEchoFunction' indicates this BFD session operates in  the Demand mode, and doesn't support the Echo Function.

There are three states through which a session normally  proceeds, two for establishing a session (Init and Up)  and one for tearing down a session (Down.) This allows  a three-way handshake for both session establishment and  session teardown (assuring that both systems are aware of  all session state changes.) A fourth state (AdminDown) exists so that a session can be administratively put down  indefinitely.  The Down state means that the session is down (or has just been  created.) A session remains in Down state until the remote  system indicates that it agrees that the session is down by  sending a BFD Control packet with the State field set to  anything other than Up. If that packet signals Down state,  the session advances to Init state; if that packet signals  Init state, the session advances to Up state.  Init state means that the remote system is 0communicating,  and the local system desires to bring the session up, but  the remote system does not yet realize it. A session will  remain in Init state until either a BFD Control Packet is  received that is signaling Init or Up state (in which case  the session advances to Up state) or until the detection time  expires, meaning that communication with the remote system  has been lost (in which case the session advances to Down state.) Up state means that the BFD session has successfully been established, and implies that connectivity between the systems  is working. The session will remain in the Up state until either  connectivity fails, or the session is taken down administratively. If either the remote system signals Down state, or the detection  time expires, the session advances to Down state. AdminDown state means that the session is being held  administratively down. This causes the remote system to enter  Down state, and remain there until the local system exits  AdminDown state.   DEFVAL { down }

Access point (AP) Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device that commonly connects and transports data between a wireless network and a wired network. Access control (AC) To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge wireless and wired network. Radio The chip set to receive and send wireless signal. Fat AP Applied in the home, SOHO and so on, and it could independently work without help from AC. Fit AP Applied in the enterprise environment, it will work under the control and management from AC. Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol The short name of protocol is CAPWAP. AC will control and manage AP by CAPWAP tunnel protocol defined by IETF. Also, a data tunnel will be set up between AC and AP. Basic Service Set The IEEE 802.11 BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. It will be identified by BSSID.

GLOSSARY IEEE 802.11 Standard to encourage interoperability among wireless networking equipment. Access point (AP) Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device that commonly connects and transports data between a wireless network and a wired network. Access control (AC) To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge wireless and wired network. Fat AP Applied in the home, SOHO and so on, and it could work independently without help from AC. Fit AP Applied in the enterprise environment, it will work under the control and management from AC. Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol The short name of protocol is CAPWAP. AC will control and manage AP by CAPWAP tunnel protocol defined by IETF. Also, a data tunnel will be set up between AC and AP. BSS IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell). The BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. Radio The chip set to receive and send wireless signal. Association The service used to establish access point or station mapping and enable STA invocation of the distribution system services. (Wireless clients attempt to connect to access points.) Basic Rate A data rate that is mandatory for client devices to support in order for them to achieve successful association.

GLOSSARY IEEE 802.11 Standard to encourage interoperability among wireless networking equipment. Access point (AP) Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device that commonly connects and transports data between a wireless network and a wired network. Access control (AC) To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge wireless and wired network. Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol The short name of protocol is CAPWAP. AC will control and manage AP by CAPWAP tunnel protocol defined by IETF. Also, a data tunnel will be set up between AC and AP. BSS IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell). The BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associated with the AP. station (Client Station) A wireless device in a wireless network associated with an access point. MIC Message Integrity Check. A MIC can, optionally, be added to WEP-encrypted 802.11 frames. SSID Radio Service Set ID. It is used for identification during association. STA (WSTA) A non-AP 802.11 wireless station. WEP Wired Equivalent Privacy. 'WEP' is generally used to refer to 802.11 encryption. RSSI It is the received signal strength indication. It suggests the quality of received signal. RTS Request to Send, it is used to gain control of the medium for the transmission of 'large' frames, in which 'large' is defined by the RTS threshold in the network card driver. CTS Clear to Send, it is used to answer RTS frames. AKM The authentication and key management method defined by 802.11i, and which includes 802.1x and pre-shared key.

Access control (AC) To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge wireless and wired network. Fat AP Applied in the home, SOHO and so on, and it could work independently without help from AC. Fit AP Applied in the enterprise environment, it will work under the control and management from AC. Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol The short name of protocol is CAPWAP. AC will control and manage AP by CAPWAP tunnel protocol defined by IETF. Also, a data tunnel will be set up between AC and AP. BSS IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell). The BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. Radio The chip set to receive and send wireless signal. Association The service used to establish access point or station mapping and enable station invocation of the distribution system services. (Wireless clients attempt to connect to access points.) Basic Rate A data rate that is mandatory for client devices to support in order for them to achieve successful association. MSDU MAC Service Data Unit, it is frame format defined by 802.11. TU It is 1,024 microseconds (ms), which is about 1 millisecond. AKM The authentication and key management method defined by 802.11i, and which includes 802.1x and pre-shared key.

GLOSSARY Wireless Intrusion Detection Sensor (WIDS) WIDS is designed to be employed in an area that is serviced by an existing wireless network. It aids in the early detection of malicious outsider attacks and intrusions via wireless networks. Rogue AP A rogue access point is any Wi-Fi access point connected to the network without authorization. As it is not authorized, if there is any weakness in the AP, the hacker will have chance to compromise the network. Rogue Station It is similiar to Rogue AP, while it is a station. Monitor AP An AP will scan or listen to the air, and try to detect wireless attack in the network. Some AP products will work only in monitor role, while some AP products could switch between normal AP role (only provide wireless access service)and monitor AP role. Ad Hoc Mode Station could work under Ad hoc mode, then they could directly do peer-to-peer communication without other device support.

GLOSSARY IEEE 802.11 Standard to encourage interoperability among wireless networking equipment. WMM WMM is a wireless QoS protocol designed to preferentially transmit packets with high priority, thus guaranteeing better QoS services for voice and video applications in a wireless network. EDCA Enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) is a channel contention mechanism designed by WMM to preferentially transmit packets with high priority and allocate more bandwidth to such packets. AC Access category (AC), is used for channel contention. WMM defines four access categories; they are AC-VO (voice), AC-VI (video), AC-BE (best-effort), and AC-BK (background) in the descending order of priority. When contending for a channel, a high-priority AC preempts a low-priority AC. CAC Connection admission control (CAC) limits the number of clients that are using high-priority ACs (AC-VO and AC-VI) to guarantee sufficient bandwidth for existing high-priority traffic. U-APSD Unscheduled automatic power-save delivery (U-APSD) is a new power saving mechanism defined by WMM to enhance the power saving capability of clients. SVP SpectraLink voice priority (SVP) is a voice priority protocol designed by the Spectralink company to guarantee QoS for voice traffic.

The BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. Radio The chip set to receive and send wireless signal. HA The AC to which a wireless station is connected by associating with an AP for the first time is the HA of the station. FA An AC that is other than the HA and to which a station is currently connected is an FA of the station. Fast-roam capable station A wireless station which directly associates to a fast-roam service (rsn+dot1X) with one AC for the first time. Roam-out station A wireless station which has associated with an AC other than the HA in the mobility-group is referred to as a roam-out station at its HA. Roam-in station A wireless station which has associated with an AC other than the HA in the mobility-group is referred to as a roam-in station at the FA. Intra-AC roaming A procedure where a wireless station roams from one AP to another AP, which are connected to the same AC. Inter-AC roaming A procedure where a wireless station roams from one AP to another AP, which are connected to different ACs. Inter-AC fast roaming capability If a station uses 802.1x (RSN) authentication through negotiation, this station has inter-AC fast roaming capability. WLAN-tunnel One type of layer 2 interface which is bound with an IACTP data tunnel and used to tunnel unicast/broadcast frames between ACs.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.83.4.1.1.6,HH3C-EOC-COMMON-MIB::hh3cEOCComUniCurrentSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,, An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295). For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.83.4.1.1.7,HH3C-EOC-COMMON-MIB::hh3cEOCComUniCurrentDuplex,INTEGER,read-only,,current,full(1):half(2):unknown(3), The current mode of operation of the MAC entity. 'unknown' indicates that the current duplex mode could not be determined. Management control of the duplex mode is accomplished through the MAU MIB. When an interface does not support autonegotiation, or when autonegotiation is not enabled, the duplex mode is controlled using ifMauDefaultType. When autonegotiation is supported and enabled, duplex mode is controlled using ifMauAutoNegAdvertisedBits. In either case, the currently operating duplex mode is reflected both in this object and in ifMauType. Note that this object provides redundant information with ifMauType. Normally, redundant objects are discouraged. However, in this instance, it allows a management application to determine the duplex status of an interface without having to know every possible value of ifMauType. This was felt to be sufficiently valuable to justify the redundancy.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.2.83.4.1.1.11,HH3C-EOC-COMMON-MIB::hh3cEOCComUniAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,, This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non- volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of hh3cEOCComUniAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of hh3cEOCComUniAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the hh3cEOCComUniAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex and hh3cEOCUniIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of hh3cEOCComUniType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.

The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment could. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.

The change maybe originate from NMS, DHCP server or administrator. The management interfaces are the interfaces that assigned by administrator, which can be used to manage device, but may be inactive for link fault or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) missing. The active management interface means an active interface, the IP address of which can be used for network management. This notification announces useful management IP address change. So it is triggered by significative IP address change. Suppose that two management interfaces on a device, Interface-A and Interface-B. Initially both interfaces are down and assigned no IP address. Configure Interface-A as the primary monitored interface, Interface-B as the secondary. Significative IP address change in following cases: 1. If Interface-A is assigned an IP address primarily, and it is linking up, then Interface-B will be ignored. A notification will be triggered, appending IP address of Interface-A. 2. If Interface-B is assigned an IP address primarily, and it is linking up, then Interface-A will be ignored. A notification will be triggered, appending IP address of Interface-B. 3. If IP address of that interface, which had its IP address announced to NMS, is changed since last notification triggered, then another notification will be sent to NMS. 4. Suppore that Interface-A was linked up and assigned an IP address primarily. If for some unknown reason, Interface-A is down or loses IP address, and Interface-B is assigned an IP address which is different with that announced to NMS before, then a notification will be triggered, appending the new IP address that Interface-B assigned. 5. A notification appending new IP address that Interface-A assigned will be triggered, if 4 occurs to Interface-B.

Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled.  Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe.  During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4).

If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds.  This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).

For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds.  The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.

If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated.

When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3).  After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold.  This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.8.4.4.1.1.9,HH3C-RMON-EXT-MIB::hh3cprialarmFallingThreshold,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic.

The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index.  This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.25506.8.4.4.1.1.11,HH3C-RMON-EXT-MIB::hh3cprialarmFallingEventIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index.

The purpose of this table is to provide a mechanism for specifying a contiguous range of vpi's with a contiguous range of vci's, or a 'label range' for LDP Entities. LDP Entities which use ATM must have at least one entry in this table.

One entry in this table contains information on a single range of labels represented by the configured Upper and Lower Bounds VPI/VCI pairs. NOTE: The ranges for a specific LDP Entity are UNIQUE and non-overlapping. For example, for a specific LDP Entity index, there could be one entry having ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/32, and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/100, and a second entry for this same interface with ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/101 and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/200. However, there could not be a third entry with ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/200 and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/300 because this label range overlaps with the second entry (i.e. both entries now have 0/200). A row will not be created unless a unique and non-overlapping range is specified. Thus, row creation implies a one-shot row creation of LDP EntityID and ConfLowerBound vpi/vci and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci. At least one label range entry for a specific LDP Entity MUST include the default VPI/VCI values denoted in the LDP Entity Table.

Example A describes the relation between values of hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList and hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList. Example A: hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList: '00000002 0C000022 00000007' hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList: '00000002 00000001 00000002' Every four octets represent an integer value. The first four octets of them should be same. Here the value '00000002' indicates there are two inbound mirror sources. The following every four octets of hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList indicate an ifIndex or a slot number of mirror source. For '0C000022' and '00000007' in the value of hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList above, the corresponding value of hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList is '00000001' and '00000002'(00000001 means the mirror source is port, 00000002 means the  mirror source is board, the meaning reference the object Hh3cMirrorOrMonitorType),  then '0C000022' indicates an ifIndex value 201326626(decimal), and '00000007'  indicates a slot with number 7(decimal). Values with different types(port/board) should be set in separate set operations. If one value with port type and one value with board type are set with same hh3cMirroringGroupID separately, the result of get operation for that entry will be like the example A above.  If hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList is not supported, the first four octets of hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList also indicates the number of mirror source, but the following octets are values for ifIndex(port type). hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorOutboundIfIndexList and hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorOutTypeList are a pair and have the same relations like hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList and hh3cMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList pair.

The table consists of the circuits being established, established, and as an implementation option, circuits that have been disconnected. For circuits carried over transport connections, an entry is created after the CUR_cs was sent or received. For circuits between two locally attached devices, or internal virtual MAC addresses, an entry is created when the equivalent of CUR_cs sent/received status is reached. End station 1 (S1) and End station 2 (S2) are used to represent the two end stations of the circuit. S1 is always an end station which is locally attached. S2 may be locally attached or remote. If it is locally attached, the circuit will be represented by two rows indexed by (A, B) and (B, A) where A & B are the relevant MACs/SAPs. The table may be used to store the causes of disconnection of circuits.

.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.4,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTimeout,INTEGER,read-create,,current,,This object should reflect the expected maximum round trip time for communicating with the transport address defined by this row. When a message is sent to this address, and a response (if one is expected) is not received within this time period, an implementation may assume that the response will not be delivered. Note that the time interval that an application waits for a response may actually be derived from the value of this object. The method for deriving the actual time interval is implementation dependent. One such method is to derive the expected round trip time based on a particular retransmission algorithm and on the number of timeouts which have occurred. The type of message may also be considered when deriving expected round trip times for retransmissions. For example, if a message is being sent with a securityLevel that indicates both authentication and privacy, the derived value may be increased to compensate for extra processing time spent during authentication and encryption processing.
