.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2,SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3,SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5,SNMPv2-MIB::sysName,OCTET,read-write,,current,,An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6,SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone closet, 3rd floor'). If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).

The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.

One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType.

Also, implementations which authenticate community-based SNMP messages using check(s) in addition to matching the community name (for example, by also checking whether the message originated from a transport address allowed to use a specified community name) MAY include in this value the number of messages which failed the additional check(s). It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any security model which is used to authenticate community-based SNMP messages specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value.

The value of this object should be the name of the interface as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's `console'. This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface as named by the device, then each will have the same value of ifName. Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP queries concerning an interface on some other (proxied) device, then the value of ifName for such an interface is the proxied device's local name for it. If there is no local name, or this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1,IF-MIB::ifTestEntry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,An entry containing objects for invoking tests on an interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.1,IF-MIB::ifTestId,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,This object identifies the current invocation of the interface's test.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.6,IF-MIB::ifTestOwner,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The entity which currently has the 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.3,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3),This object has the value nonVolatile(3) for those entries in the table which are valid and will not be deleted by the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value volatile(2) are valid and exist, but have not been saved, so that will not exist after the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value other(1) are valid and exist but are not classified as to whether they will continue to exist after the next restart.
