.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::sysDescr,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software. It is mandatory that this only contain printable ASCII characters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::sysObjectID,OBJECT,read-only,,mandatory,,The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::sysUpTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,mandatory,,The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5,RFC1213-MIB::sysName,OCTET,read-write,,mandatory,,An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6,RFC1213-MIB::sysLocation,OCTET,read-write,,mandatory,,The physical location of this node (e.g., `telephone closet, 3rd floor').
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,RFC1213-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity primarily offers. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero, Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs primarily routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., IP gateways) 4 end-to-end (e.g., IP hosts) 7 applications (e.g., mail relays) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,RFC1213-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,mandatory,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,RFC1213-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,The interface's address at the protocol layer immediately `below' the network layer in the protocol stack.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,RFC1213-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,mandatory,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,RFC1213-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of non-unicast (i.e., subnetwork- broadcast or subnetwork-multicast) packets delivered to a higher-layer protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,RFC1213-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,RFC1213-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,mandatory,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. For example, if the interface is realized by an ethernet, then the value of this object refers to a document defining objects specific to ethernet. If this information is not present, its value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }, which is a syntatically valid object identifier, and any conformant implementation of ASN.1 and BER must be able to generate and recognize this value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.4,RFC1213-MIB::ipInHdrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams discarded due to errors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IP options, etc.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipInAddrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams discarded because the IP address in their IP header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space). Note that this counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.9,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDelivers,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of input datagrams successfully delivered to IP user-protocols (including ICMP).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.10,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutRequests,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of IP datagrams which local IP user-protocols (including ICMP) supplied to IP in requests for transmission. Note that this counter does not include any datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams.

Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.13,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmTimeout,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The maximum number of seconds which received fragments are held while they are awaiting reassembly at this entity.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.16,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of failures detected by the IP re- assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc). Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms (notably the algorithm in RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.17,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragOKs,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been successfully fragmented at this entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.18,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been discarded because they needed to be fragmented at this entity but could not be, e.g., because their Don't Fragment flag was set.

For example, when the Internet standard all-ones broadcast address is used, the value will be 1. This value applies to both the subnet and network broadcasts addresses used by the entity on this (logical) interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.20.1.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipAdEntReasmMaxSize,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The size of the largest IP datagram which this entity can re-assemble from incoming IP fragmented datagrams received on this interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteDest,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,The destination IP address of this route. An entry with a value of 0.0.0.0 is considered a default route. Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric1,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The primary routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.4,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric2,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric3,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric4,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteNextHop,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,The IP address of the next hop of this route. (In the case of a route bound to an interface which is realized via a broadcast media, the value of this field is the agent's IP address on that interface.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteType,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,other(1):invalid(2):direct(3):indirect(4),The type of route. Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipRouteType object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.9,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteProto,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,other(1):local(2):netmgmt(3):icmp(4):egp(5):ggp(6):hello(7):rip(8):is-is(9):es-is(10):ciscoIgrp(11):bbnSpfIgp(12):ospf(13):bgp(14),The routing mechanism via which this route was learned. Inclusion of values for gateway routing protocols is not intended to imply that hosts should support those protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.10,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteAge,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The number of seconds since this route was last updated or otherwise determined to be correct. Note that no semantics of `too old' can be implied except through knowledge of the routing protocol by which the route was learned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.11,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMask,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,Indicate the mask to be logical-ANDed with the destination address before being compared to the value in the ipRouteDest field. For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0. It should be noted that all IP routing subsystems implicitly use this mechanism.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric5,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.

If this information is not present, its value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }, which is a syntatically valid object identifier, and any conformant implementation of ASN.1 and BER must be able to generate and recognize this value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22,RFC1213-MIB::ipNetToMediaTable,,not-accessible,,mandatory,,The IP Address Translation table used for mapping from IP addresses to physical addresses.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.4,RFC1213-MIB::ipNetToMediaType,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,other(1):invalid(2):dynamic(3):static(4),The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,RFC1213-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.5.15,RFC1213-MIB::icmpOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of ICMP messages which this entity did not send due to problems discovered within ICMP such as a lack of buffers. This value should not include errors discovered outside the ICMP layer such as the inability of IP to route the resultant datagram.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value. If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the connection. As an implementation-specific option, a RST segment may be sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note however that RST segments are not sent reliably).

When read, this variable always returns the most recent value that egpNeighEventTrigger was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the node, it returns a value of `stop'. When set, this variable causes a Start or Stop event on the specified neighbor, as specified on pages 8-10 of RFC 904. Briefly, a Start event causes an Idle peer to begin neighbor acquisition and a non-Idle peer to reinitiate neighbor acquisition. A stop event causes a non-Idle peer to return to the Idle state until a Start event occurs, either via egpNeighEventTrigger or otherwise.
