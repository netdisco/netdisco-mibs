the current version of the rittal mibs came from RITTAL_CMC-III_MIB_V_3_15_70.zip
this also included an old version of SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB where the snmpCommunityGroup
had not yet been renamed to snmpCommunityTableGroup.

RITTAL-CMC-III-CAPABILITY-MIB uses this old object in 2 places, so these have been
manually changed to snmpCommunityTableGroup.
