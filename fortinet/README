fortinet-fortigate-mib.mib has manually readded device id's. keep this in
mind when submitting patches. we require these devices to be readded.
this isn't all that hard, a short procedure follows:


# we will create a staging area to pre-prepare our mibs before the actual import,
# for this we'll create the directory /tmp/f2
  mkdir /tmp/f2

# copy new fortigate mib to /tmp/f2,  in this case FORTINET-FORTIGATE-MIB-build0231.mib
  cp ~/FORTINET-FORTIGATE-MIB-build0231.mib /tmp/f2

# now safe the removed hardware, this we'll do under our user tmp
  mkdir ~/tmp
  cd ~/tmp

# make a list of all models in both the current mib and the new one
  grep 'OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { fgModel' ~/netdisco-mibs/fortinet/fortinet-fortigate-mib.mib >> ~/tmp/fgmodels.patch
  grep 'OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { fgModel' /tmp/f2/FORTINET-FORTIGATE-MIB-build0231.mib  >> ~/tmp/fgmodels.patch

# sort by model oid, removing all exact duplicates
  cat fgmodels.patch  | sort -n -k 7 | uniq > uniqfg

# if a name has changed but the oid has remained the same the
# double oids will be listed now
  uniq -d -f 5 uniqfg

# edit the file uniqfg and manually remove the doubles
  vi uniqfg

# now we'll prepare a mib which will include all models
  cd /tmp/f2
  cp FORTINET-FORTIGATE-MIB-build0231.mib fortinet-fortigate-mib-patched.mib

# edit fortinet-fortigate-mib-patched.mib, remove ALL fgModel model entries
# then insert the list we made before (~/tmp/uniqfg) in it's place
# in vi this can be done with:
#       :.!cat ~/tmp/uniqfg
# now copy the mib to staging and follow the normal upgrade procedure
  mkdir /tmp/fortinet
  cp fortinet-fortigate-mib-patched.mib /tmp/fortinet

# if prepmibs says your file is to old:
< FORTINET-FORTIGATE-MIB is older (201807200000 < 201901170000) (in 'fortinet-fortigate-mib.mib')
✔ MIBs ready for import.

# you can, after reviewing the new mib, overwrite 
# fnFortiGateMib MODULE-IDENTITY
#    LAST-UPDATED "201901170000Z"
# just raise it by 1 hour
#    201901170000Z -> 201901170100Z

# finally, make a note at the top of this file of which mib you added
# and with what product version it came
