DESCRIPTION
     "This MIB file contains the information that the receiving party needs
     in order to interpret SNMP traps sent by NSX Manager.

     VMware NSX for vSphere is a key product in the SDDC architecture. With
     NSX, virtualization delivers for networking what it has already delivered
     for compute and storage. In much the same way that server virtualization
     programmatically creates, snapshots, deletes and restores software-based
     virtual machines (VMs), NSX network virtualization programmatically
     creates, snapshots, deletes, and restores software-based virtual
     networks. The result is a completely transformative approach to
     networking that not only enables data center managers to achieve orders
     of magnitude better agility and economics, but also allows for a vastly
     simplified operational model for the underlying physical network. With
     the ability to be deployed on any IP network, including both existing
     traditional networking models and next-generation fabric architectures
     from any vendor, NSX is a completely non-disruptive solution. In fact,
     with NSX, the physical network infrastructure you already have is all you
     need to deploy a software-defined data center.

     The NSX Manager provides the graphical user interface (GUI) and the REST
     APIs for creating, configuring, and monitoring NSX components, such as
     controllers, logical switches, and edge services gateways. The NSX
     Manager provides an aggregated system view and is the centralized network
     management component of NSX. NSX Manager is installed as a virtual
     appliance on any ESX host in your vCenter environment.
