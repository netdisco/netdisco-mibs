        DESCRIPTION "********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED *********

                    This table is used to map an interface index to a
                    logical entity index.  This table is mainly used
                    by autodiscovery to figure out which entLogicalIndex
                    corresponds to a particular network address.  This
                    table is not intended as a general purpose mapping.
                    In particular, in some systems the same interface
                    can be in use by multiple logical entities.  Also,
                    there is no requirement that ifIndex is unique
                    across all logical entities (such as the case where
                    multiple agents in the same chassis each assign
                    ifIndex without knowledge of how the other agents
                    are assigning ifIndex).  Therefore, these mappings
                    are only defined to hold for the special purpose
                    of getting from the discovered transport address for
                    a logical device to the entLogicalIndex needed for
                    announce address and search address.  Also, note
                    that this table will not contain entries for all
                    of the values of ifIndex.  It will only contain
                    entries for interfaces that can be used for sending
                    announcement packets for some logical entity."

        DESCRIPTION "The type of events that will be sent to this trap

                    'system event' traps that will be sent to a specific
                    receiver.

                    This filter is specified as a sum of values, where
                    each value specifies a classification of traps that
                    will be sent to this trap receiver.  The value for a
                    particular trap class C is computed as 2 raised to
                    a value representing C.  The trap classes are
                    defined as follows:

                    C (bit#)   Trap class
                    -----------------------------------------------
                    0          SNMP traps

                    4          debug events (HP internal use only)

                    For example, to specify that this trap receiver
                    should receive SNMP traps and critical event traps,
                    this object should be set to a value of 9 (2^0 +
