        The octet string value represents the contents of the control list as
        an ordered list of entries, each encoded as a TLV, as follows.
        The first octet  of each TLV is interpreted as an
        unsigned integer representing a gate operation name:
            0: SetGateStates
            1: Set-And-Hold-MAC
            2: Set-And-Release-MAC
            3-255: Reserved for future gate operations
            
        The second octet of the TLV is the length field, 
        interpreted as an unsigned integer, indicating the number of
        octets of the value that follows the length. A length of
        zero indicates that there is no value 
        (i.e., the gate operation has no parameters).
        
        The third through (3 + length -1)th octets encode the 
        parameters of the gate operation, in the order that they 
        appear in the definition of the operation
        in Table 8-6. Two parameter types are currently defined:
        
        - GateState:
            A GateState parameter is encoded in a single octet.
            The bits of the octet represent the gate states for the 
            corresponding traffic classes; the MS bit corresponds
            to traffic class 7,
            the LS bit to traffic class 0. A bit value of 0 indicates
            closed; a bit value of 1 indicates open.
            
        - TimeInterval: 
            A TimeInterval is encoded in 4 octets as a 32-bit 
            unsigned integer, representing a number of nanoseconds.
            The first octet encodes the most significant 8 bits of the 
            integer, and the fourth octet encodes the least 
            significant 8 bits.
