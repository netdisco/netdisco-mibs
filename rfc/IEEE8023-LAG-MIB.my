        NOTE-From the perspective of the Link Aggregation
        mechanisms described in Clause 6, only a single
        combination of Actor's System ID and System Priority are
        considered, and no distinction is made between the
        values of these parameters for an Aggregator and the
        port(s) that are associated with it; i.e., the protocol
        is described in terms of the operation of aggregation
        within a single System. However, the managed objects
        provided for the Aggregator and the port both allow
        management of these parameters. The result of this is to
        permit a single piece of equipment to be configured by
        management to contain more than one System from the
        point of view of the operation of Link Aggregation. This
        may be of particular use in the configuration of
        equipment that has limited aggregation capability (see 6.7)."
